    "context":"Supreme Court of India MS N.N. Global Mercantile Private ... vs MS Indo Unique Flame Ltd. on 11 January, 2021 Author Indu Malhotra Bench Indira Banerjee, Indu Malhotra, Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 3802 - 3803  2020 Arising out of SLP Civil Nos.13132-13133 of 2020 Ms. N.N. GLOBAL MERCANTILE PVT. LTD.  Appellant Versus Ms. INDO UNIQUE FLAME LTD.  OTHERS  Respondents JUDGMENT INDU MALHOTRA, J. 1 This case raises interesting issues with respect to the application of the doctrine of separability of an arbitration agreement from the underlying substantive contract in which it is embedded whether an arbitration agreement would be non-existent in law, invalid or un-enforceable, if the underlying contract was not stamped as per the relevant Stamp Act and, whether allegations of fraudulent invocation of the bank guarantee furnished under the substantive contract, would be an arbitrable dispute. 1.1 The Respondent No.1-Indo Unique Flame Ltd. Indo Unique applied for grant of work of beneficiationwashing of coal to the Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. KPCL in an open tender. KPCL awarded the Work Order vide letter of Award No.A1M1B3Washed Coal1052 dated 18.09.2015 to Indo Unique. In pursuance of the Work Order dated 18.09.2015, the Respondent No.1 Company furnished Bank Guarantees for Rs.29.29 crores in favour of KPCL through its bankers, State Bank of India SBI, the Respondent No.2 herein. 1.2 Indo Unique, the Respondent No.1 herein, subsequently entered into a sub-contract termed as a Work Order dated 28.09.2015 with the Appellant Company  Ms. N.N. Global Mercantile Pvt. Ltd. Global Mercantile, for the transportation of coal from its washery at Village Punwat, District Yavatmal to the stockyard, siding, coal handling and loading into the wagons at Pandharpaoni siding, District Chanderpur, Maharashtra. Clause 9 of the Work Order provided for furnishing a security deposit which reads as  9. Security Deposit  You will submit the Bank Guarantee for Rs.5.00 crores for the average stock of washed coal lying at your stockyard. This Bank Guarantee can be issued from any nationalised Bankfirst class bank, initially valid for a period of 18 eighteen months. Clause 10 of the Work Order incorporates an arbitration clause, which reads as 10. Arbitration  In case of any dispute due to difference of opinion in interpretation of any clause or terms and conditions or meaning of the work or language the decision of the arbitrator appointed with mutual consent shall be treated as final and binding on both the parties. 1.3 As per Clause 9 of the Work Order, Global Mercantile furnished a Bank Guarantee for Rs.3,36,00,000- on 30.09.2015, in favour of SBI-the banker of Indo Unique. The Bank Guarantee was extended from time to time, and was last extended on 10.11.2017. 1.4 Under the principal contract with KPCL dated 18.09.2015, certain disputes and differences arose with Indo Unique, which led to the invocation of the Bank Guarantee by KPCL on 06.12.2017. 1.5 Indo Unique, on 07.12.2017, invoked the Bank Guarantee furnished by Global Mercantile under the Work Order. It is the invocation of this Guarantee which has led to the present proceedings. 1.6 Global Mercantile filed a Civil Commercial Suit No.62 of 2017 against Indo Unique, and its banker SBI, as also the banker of the Appellant i.e. the Union Bank of India Respondent No.3 herein, before the Commercial Court, Nagpur praying inter alia for a declaration that Indo Unique was not entitled to encash the bank guarantee as the Work Order had not been acted upon. It was expressly stated that Indo Unique had not allotted any work under the Work Order, nor were any invoices raised, or payments made by it. Consequently, there was no loss suffered which would justify the invocation of the Bank Guarantee. It was alleged that the invocation of the Bank Guarantee was fraudulent, since it was not in terms of the Work Order, being a conditional guarantee linked to the performance of work. The Commercial Court vide an ex parte ad interim Order dated 15.12.2017 directed status-quo to be maintained with respect to the enforcement of the Bank Guarantee. 1.7 Indo Unique filed an application under Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 Arbitration Act in Civil Commercial Suit No.62 of 2017, seeking reference of disputes to arbitration. Global Mercantile opposed the application under Section 8 as being not maintainable since the Bank Guarantee was a separate and independent contract, and did not contain any arbitration clause. 1.8 The Commercial Court vide Order dated 18.01.2018 rejected the application under Section 8, and held that the arbitration clause in the Work Order dated 28.09.2015 was not a general arbitration clause, which would cover the Bank Guarantee. The Bank Guarantee was an independent contract between SBI and Union Bank of India for due performance of the contract. The Court noted the contention of Global Mercantile that neither of the parties had performed any part of the Work Order dated 28.09.2015, and consequently held that the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court was not ousted by the arbitration agreement. 1.9 Indo Unique then filed Civil Revision Petition No.9 of 2018 before the Bombay High Court challenging the Order passed by the Commercial Court. On an objection being raised on the maintainability of the Civil Revision Petition, the High Court vide Order dated 09.07.2020 permitted the withdrawal of the Civil Revision Petition, with liberty to file a petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. 1.10 Indo Unique filed W.P. No.1801 of 2020 before the Bombay High Court to quash and set aside the Order dated 18.01.2018 passed by the Commercial CourtDistrict Judge-I, Nagpur in Civil Commercial Suit No.622017. The High Court vide the Impugned Judgment dated 30.09.2020 held that it was the admitted position that there was an arbitration agreement between the parties, and therefore the application under Section 8 was maintainable. With respect to the contention that the invocation of the Bank Guarantee was fraudulent, it was held that the allegations of fraud did not constitute a criminal offence which would entail recording of voluminous evidence. The disputes could be resolved through arbitration, and the filing of the Suit before the Commercial Court was not justified. The Commercial Court was not justified in restraining the invocation of the bank guarantee in the absence of any finding on fraud or special equities. On the issue of the arbitration agreement being unenforceable since the Work Order was unstamped, it was held that the plaintiff Appellant herein, could raise the issue either under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, or before the arbitral tribunal at the appropriate stage. The Writ Petition was held to be maintainable, since there is no absolute bar to entertain a Writ Petition even if an alternate remedy is available. The Writ Petition was allowed vide Judgment and Order dated 30.09.2020, and the Order dated 18.01.2018 passed by the Commercial Court was set aside. On the request of the counsel for the Appellant, the High Court suspended the operation of its Order for a period of one month from 30.09.2020. 1.11 The Review Petition filed by the Appellant was withdrawn vide Order dated 28.10.2020 passed in Review Application ST No. 9819 of 2020. On the request by the counsel for the Appellant, the Order of stay was continued till 20.11.2020. 1.12 Aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, Global Mercantile has filed the present Special Leave Petition before this Court. 2. The issues which have arisen for our consideration are  i. Whether an arbitration agreement would be enforceable and acted upon, even if the Work Order dated 28.09.2015 is unstamped and un-enforceable under the Stamp Act? ii. Whether allegation of the fraudulent invocation of the bank guarantee is an arbitrable dispute? iii. Whether a Writ Petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution would be maintainable to challenge an Order rejecting an application for reference to arbitration under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act? We will now deal with each of these issues. 3 Validity of an arbitration agreement in an unstamped agreement 3.1 It is well settled in arbitration jurisprudence that an arbitration agreement is a distinct and separate agreement, which is independent from the substantive commercial contract in which it is embedded. This is based on the premise that when parties enter into a commercial contract containing an arbitration clause, they are entering into two separate agreements viz. i the substantive contract which contains the rights and obligations of the parties arising from the commercial transaction and, ii the arbitration agreement which contains the binding obligation of the parties to resolve their disputes through the mode of arbitration. 3.2 The autonomy of the arbitration agreement is based on the twin concepts of separability and kompetenz  kompetenz. The doctrines of separability and kompetenz  kompetenz though inter-related, are distinct, and play an important role in promoting the autonomy of the arbitral process. 3.3 The doctrine of separability of the arbitration agreement connotes that the invalidity, ineffectiveness, or termination of the substantive commercial contract, would not affect the validity of the arbitration agreement, except if the arbitration agreement itself is directly impeached on the ground that the arbitration agreement is void ab initio. 3.4 The doctrine of kompetenz  kompetenz implies that the arbitral tribunal has the competence to determine and rule on its own jurisdiction, including objections with respect to the existence, validity, and scope of the arbitration agreement, in the first instance, which is subject to judicial scrutiny by the courts at a later stage of the proceedings. Under the Arbitration Act, the challenge before the Court is maintainable only after the final award is passed as provided by sub-section 6 of Section 16. The stage at which the order of the tribunal regarding its jurisdiction is amenable to judicial review, varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The doctrine of kompetenz  kompetenz has evolved to minimize judicial intervention at the pre-reference stage, and reduce unmeritorious challenges raised on the issue of jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. 3.5 The doctrine of separability was expounded in the judgment of Heyman v. Darwins Ltd1 by the House of Lords wherein it was held that English common law had been evolving towards the recognition of an arbitration clause as a separate contract which survives the termination of the main contract. Lord Wright in his opinion stated that  An arbitration agreement is collateral to the substantial stipulations of the contract. It is merely procedural and ancillary, it is a mode of settling disputes, though the agreement to do so is itself subject to the discretion of the court. Lord MacMillan in his opinion stated that  It survives for the purpose of measuring the claims arising out of the breach, and the arbitration clause survives for determining the mode of their settlement. The purposes of the contract have failed, but the arbitration clause is not one of the purposes of the contract. 3.6 This rule has been affirmed in several cases, including Bremer Vulkan Schiffbau und Maschinefabrik v. South India Shipping Corporation2 in which Lord Diplock cited Heyman as an authority for the assertion that  1 1942 AC 356. 2 1981 AC 909. The arbitration clause constitutes a self-contained contract collateral or ancillary to the shipbuilding agreement itself. 3.7 In Harbour Assurance v. Kansa General International Insurance,3 the Court of Appeal held that if the arbitration clause is not directly impeached, an arbitration agreement is capable of surviving the invalidity of the contract, so that the arbitrator has the jurisdiction to determine the initial validity of the contract. It was opined that Once it became accepted that the arbitration clause is a separate agreement, ancillary to the contract, the logical impediment to referring an issue of the invalidity of the contract to arbitration disappears. Provided that the arbitration clause itself is not directly impeached eg by a non-est factum plea, the arbitration agreement is as a matter of principled legal theory capable of surviving the invalidity of the contract. 3.8 In Lesotho Highlands Development Authority v. Impregilo SpA and others,4 the House of Lords affirmed the view taken in Harbour Assurance supra, wherein it was held that an arbitration agreement is a distinct and separable agreement from the underlying or principal contract. 21. It is part of the very alphabet of arbitration law as explained in Harbour Assurance Co v. Kansa General International Insurance,  spelled out in s. 7 of the Act, that the arbitration agreement is a distinct and separable agreement from the underlying or principal contract. 3.9 Article 161 of the Model Law incorporates the doctrine of separability  Article 16. The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms a part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. 3 1993 1 Lloyds Rep. 455 CA. 4 2005 UKHL 43  2006 1 A.C. 221 at 21. 3.10 The French Cour de Cassation recognised the doctrine of separability in broad terms in the Gosset v. Caparelli,5 wherein it was held that In international arbitration, the agreement to arbitrate, whether concluded separately or included in the contract to which it relates, is always save in exceptional circumstances,  completely autonomous in law which excludes the possibility of it being affected by the possible invalidity of the main contract. 3.11 The doctrine of kompetenz  kompetenz is based on the premise that the arbitration agreement is separate and independent from the substantive underlying contract in which it is embedded. Equally, an arbitration agreement exists and can be acted upon irrespective of whether the main substantive contract is valid or not. The Court of Appeal in the seminal decision rendered in Fiona Trust  Holding Corporation v. Privalov,6 held that the allegation of invalidity of the underlying contract, would not preclude the arbitral tribunal from determining the said issue in the first instance, even though the alleged illegality would render the contract void from inception. In this case, the arbitration agreement was contained in a charter party agreement, wherein it was alleged that it had been procured through bribery by the owners agent, and was invalid from its inception. It was held that only if the arbitration agreement is itself directly impeached, and rendered void or unenforceable on grounds which relate to the arbitration agreement itself, and not merely as a consequence of the invalidity of the underlying contract, 5 Cass. Civ. Lere, 7 May 1963 Dalloz, 1963, 545. 6 2007 EWCA Civ 20. that the courts may refuse reference to arbitration. To discourage parasitical challenges and dilatory tactics in resisting reference to arbitration, the Court of Appeal held in paragraph 38 that  38.  As we have sought to explain, once the separability of the arbitration agreement is accepted, there cannot be any question but that there is a valid agreement.  If there is a contest about whether an arbitration agreement had come into existence at all, the court would have a discretion as to whether to determine that issue itself, but that will not be the case where there is an overall contract which is said for some reason to be invalid eg for illegality, misrepresentation or bribery and the arbitration agreement is merely part of the contract.   3.12 In the Appeal filed in the Fiona Trust case before the House of Lords, in Fili Shipping Co Ltd and others v. Premium Nafta Products Ltd and others7, Lord Hoffman opined  It amounts to saying that because the main agreement and the arbitration agreement were bound up with each other, the invalidity of the main agreement should result in the invalidity of the arbitration agreement. The one should fall with the other because they would never have been separately concluded. But section 7 in my opinion means that they must be treated as having been separately concluded and the arbitration agreement can be invalidated only on a ground which relates to the arbitration agreement and is not merely a consequence of the invalidity of the main agreement. Lord Hope in his separate opinion, held that  The owners argument was not that there was no contract at all, but that they were entitled to rescind the contract including the arbitration agreement because the contract was induced by bribery. Allegations of that kind, if sound, may affect the validity of the main agreement. But they do not undermine the validity of the arbitration agreement as a distinct agreement. The doctrine of separability requires direct impeachment of the arbitration agreement before it can be set aside. This is an exacting test. The argument must be based on facts which are specific to the arbitration agreement. Allegations that are parasitical to a challenge to the validity to the main agreement will not do. That being the situation in this case, the agreement to go to arbitration must be given effect. 7 2007 UKHL 40. 3.13 The law as it stands in U.K. today is that if the court while entertaining a plea to refer the parties to arbitration, is satisfied of the existence of the arbitration agreement, it is incumbent to refer the parties to arbitration, even if objections to the validity of the substantive contract are raised. Where the arbitration agreement is embedded in an underlying contract, the court would not entertain the dispute on the issue of jurisdiction until the arbitral tribunal has ruled on this issue. Lord Hoffman opined that  But that is in my opinion exactly the kind of argument which s 7 was intended to prevent. It amounts to saying that because the main agreement and the arbitration agreement were bound up with each other, the invalidity of the main agreement should result in the invalidity of the arbitration agreement. The one should fall with the other because they would never have been separately concluded and the arbitration agreement can be invalidated only on a ground which relates to the arbitration agreement and is not merely a consequence of the invalidity of the main agreement.8 3.14 On the issue of whether a claim of fraud in the inducement of the entire contract is to be decided by the court, or the arbitrator, was considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in Prima Paint Corporation v. Flood  Conklin MFG. CO.,9 The Court held that If the claim is fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself an issue which goes to the making of the agreement to arbitratethe federal court may proceed to adjudicate it. But the statutory language does not permit the federal court to consider claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally. In so concluding, we not only honor the plain meaning of the statute but also the unmistakably clear congressional purpose that the arbitration procedure, when selected by the parties to a contract, be speedy and not subject to delay and obstruction in the courts. 8 2007 4 ALL ER 951 at 960, at paragraph 19. 9 388 US 395 1967. 3.15 The United States Supreme Court in Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc v. Cardegna et. al,10 followed the earlier decisions in Prima Paint and Southland Corp. v. Keating.11 Scalia, J. opined  Prima Paint and Southland answer the question presented here by establishing three propositions. First, as a matter of substantive federal arbitration law, an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract. Second, unless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of the contracts validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first instance. Third, this arbitration law applies in state as well as federal courts. The parties have not requested, and we do not undertake, reconsideration of those holdings. Applying them to this case, we conclude that because respondents challenge the Agreement, but not specifically its arbitration provisions, those provisions are enforceable apart from the remainder of the contract. The challenge should therefore be considered by an arbitrator, not a court. 3.16 In Rent-A- Center, West, Inc. v. Jackon,12 the U.S. Supreme Court opined  There are two types of validity challenges under  2 One type challenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate, and the other challenges the contract as a whole, either on a ground that directly affects the entire agreement e.g., the agreement was fraudulently induced, or on the ground that the illegality of one of the contracts provisions renders the whole contract invalid. Buckeye, 546 U.S., at 444. In a line of cases neither party has asked us to overrule, we held that only the first type of challenge is relevant to a courts determination whether the arbitration agreement at issue is enforceable. See Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood  Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 US 395, 403-404 1967 Buckeye, supra, at 444-446 Preston v. Ferrer, 552 US 346, 353-354 2008. That is because  2 states that a written provision to settle by arbitration a controversy is valid, irrevocable, and enforceable without mention of the validity of the contract in which it is contained. Thus, a partys challenge to another provision of the contract, or to the contract as a whole, does not prevent a court from enforcing a specific agreement to arbitrate. As a matter of substantive federal arbitration law, an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract. Buckeye, 546 U.S., at 445 see also id., at 447 the severability rule is based on 2.  The Court asserts that its holding flows logically from Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood  Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395 1967, in which the Court held that consideration of a contract revocation defense is generally a matter for the arbitrator, unless the defense is specifically directed at the arbitration clause, id., at 404. We have treated this holding as a severability rule When a party challenges a contract, but not specifically its arbitration provisions, 10 US SC 440 2006. 11 79 L Ed 2d 465 US 1 1984. 12 561 US 63 2010. those provisions are enforceable apart from the remainder of the contract. Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 US 440, 446 2006.  The second line of cases bearing on who decides the validity of an arbitration agreement, as the Court explains, involves the Prima Paint rule. See ante, at 71. That rule recognizes two types of validity challenges. One type challenges the validity of the arbitration agreement itself, on a ground arising from an infirmity in that agreement. The other challenges the validity of the arbitration agreement tangentiallyvia a claim that the entire contract of which the arbitration agreement is but a part is invalid for some reason. See Buckeye, 546 U.S., at 444. Under Prima Paint, a challenge of the first type goes to the court a challenge of the second type goes to the arbitrator. See 388 U.S., at 403-404 see also Buckeye, 546 U.S., at 444-445. The Prima Paint rule is akin to a pleading standard, whereby a party seeking to challenge the validity of an arbitration agreement must expressly say so in order to get his dispute into court. 4 The Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is based on the Model Law. Section 16 gives statutory recognition to the doctrine of separability and kompetenz  kompetenz. Section 16 provides  16. Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction 1 The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including ruling on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement, and for that purpose,  a an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract and b a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. 4.1 The legislative policy of minimal interference is enshrined in Section 5, which by a non-obstante clause prohibits judicial intervention except as specified in Part I of the Arbitration Act. A conjoint reading of Sections 5 and 16 would indicate that all civil commercial matters, including the issue as to whether the substantive contract was voidable can be resolved through arbitration. 4.2 This Court in Uttarakhand Purv Sainik Kalyan Nigam Ltd. v. Northern Coal Field Ltd.13, speaking through one of us Indu Malhotra, J. discussed the application of the doctrine of kompetenz  kompetenz in the Indian legislation, and observed  7.7. Based on the recommendations of the Law Commission, Section 11 was substantially amended by the 2015 Amendment Act, to overcome the effect of all previous judgments rendered on the scope of power by a non obstante clause, and to reinforce the kompetenz-kompetenz principle enshrined in Section 16 of the 1996 Act. The 2015 Amendment Act inserted sub-section 6-A to Section 11 which provides that 6-A The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while considering any application under sub-section 4 or sub- section 5 or sub-section 6, shall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court, confine to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. emphasis supplied 7.8. By virtue of the non obstante clause incorporated in Section 116-A, previous judgments rendered in Patel Engg. and Boghara Polyfab, were legislatively overruled. The scope of examination is now confined only to the existence of the arbitration agreement at the Section 11 stage, and nothing more. 7.9. Reliance is placed on the judgment in Duro Felguera S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd. Duro Felguera S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd., 2017 9 SCC 729  2017 4 SCC Civ 764. Refer to TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd., 2017 8 SCC 377  2017 4 SCC Civ 72 , wherein this Court held that SCC p. 759, para 48 48.  From a reading of Section 116-A, the intention of the legislature is crystal clear i.e. the court should and need only look into one aspectthe existence of an arbitration agreement. What are the factors for deciding as to whether there is an arbitration agreement is the next question. The resolution to that is simple  it needs to be seen if the agreement contains a clause which provides for arbitration pertaining to the disputes which have arisen between the parties to the agreement. emphasis supplied 7.10. In view of the legislative mandate contained in Section 116-A, the Court is now required only to examine the existence of the arbitration agreement. All other preliminary or threshold issues are left to be decided by the arbitrator under Section 16, which enshrines the kompetenz-kompetenz principle. 7.11. The doctrine of kompetenz-kompetenz, also referred to as compétence-compétence, or compétence de la recognized, implies that the Arbitral Tribunal is empowered and has the competence to rule on its own jurisdiction, including determining all jurisdictional issues, and the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. This doctrine is intended to minimise 13 2020 2 SCC 455. judicial intervention, so that the arbitral process is not thwarted at the threshold, when a preliminary objection is raised by one of the parties. The doctrine of kompetenz-kompetenz is, however, subject to the exception i.e. when the arbitration agreement itself is impeached as being procured by fraud or deception. This exception would also apply to cases where the parties in the process of negotiation, may have entered into a draft agreement as an antecedent step prior to executing the final contract. The draft agreement would be a mere proposal to arbitrate, and not an unequivocal acceptance of the terms of the agreement. Section 7 of the Contract Act, 1872 requires the acceptance of a contract to be absolute and unqualified Dresser Rand S.A. v. Bindal Agro Chem Ltd., 2006 1 SCC 751. See also BSNL v. Telephone Cables Ltd., 2010 5 SCC 213  2010 2 SCC Civ 352. Refer to PSA Mumbai Investments Pte. Ltd. v. Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, 2018 10 SCC 525  2019 1 SCC Civ 1 . If an arbitration agreement is not valid or non-existent, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot assume jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the disputes. Appointment of an arbitrator may be refused if the arbitration agreement is not in writing, or the disputes are beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement. Article V1a of the New York Convention states that recognition and enforcement of an award may be refused if the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made. 7.13. In view of the provisions of Section 16, and the legislative policy to restrict judicial intervention at the pre-reference stage, the issue of limitation would require to be decided by the arbitrator. Sub-section 1 of Section 16 provides that the Arbitral Tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. Section 16 is as an inclusive provision, which would comprehend all preliminary issues touching upon the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. The issue of limitation is a jurisdictional issue, which would be required to be decided by the arbitrator under Section 16, and not the High Court at the pre- reference stage under Section 11 of the Act. Once the existence of the arbitration agreement is not disputed, all issues, including jurisdictional objections are to be decided by the arbitrator. 4.3 In A. Ayyasamy v. Parmasivam  Ors.,14 Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. in his separate opinion observed that  53. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, should in my view be interpreted so as to bring in line the principles underlying its interpretation in a manner that is consistent with prevailing approaches in the common law world. Jurisprudence in India must evolve towards strengthening the institutional efficacy of arbitration. Deference to a forum chosen by parties as a complete remedy for resolving all their claims is but part of that evolution. Minimising the intervention of courts is again a recognition of the same principle. 14 2016 10 SCC 386. 5. We will now apply the law to the facts of the present case. 5.1 The Appellant-Global Mercantile submitted that the application under Section 8 for reference of disputes to arbitration was not maintainable, since as per Section 34 of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958 the Work Order being an unstamped document could not be received in evidence for any purpose, or acted upon, unless it is duly stamped. Consequently, the arbitration clause in the unstamped agreement also could not be acted upon or enforced since the arbitration clause would have no existence in law, unless the applicable stamp duty and penalty, if any is paid on the Work Order. Reliance was placed on paragraph 22 of the judgment in Garware Wall Ropes Limited v. Coastal Marine Constructions and Engineering Limited,15 wherein it has been held  .. that an arbitration clause in an agreement would not exist when it is not enforceable by law. It was submitted that the High Court while allowing the application under Section 8, had enforced a non-existent arbitration clause, which was in violation of Section 34 of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958 and the law laid down by this Court. It was further contended that since 03.01.2018 to date, the Respondent No.1 had not indicated its willingness to pay the stamp duty, even though the Appellant had raised this objection. There was no justifiable reason to grant any further opportunity to Respondent No.1 to pay the stamp duty, and enforce the clause in view of the judgment of this Court in Naina Thakkar v. Annapurna Builders.16 15 2019 9 SCC 209. 16 2013 14 SCC 354. 5.2 Indo Unique  the Respondent No.1 submitted that even though the Work Order dated 28.09.2015 is an unstamped agreement, it would be enforceable after it is duly stamped, for which an opportunity must be given to the parties to make up the deficient stamp duty and penalty as may be assessed by the Collector. Non-payment of stamp duty would not render the agreement unenforceable, but was a curable defect. 5.3 Statutory scheme under the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958.  a Section 3 of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958 is the charging section, which specifies the instruments which are chargeable to stamp duty of the amount specified in Schedule I of the Act. Section 3 provides 3. Instruments chargeable with duty.  Subject to the provisions of this Act and the exemptions contained in Schedule I, the following instruments shall be chargeable with duty of the amount indicated in Schedule I as the proper duty therefore respectively, that is to say a every instrument mentioned in Schedule I, which, not having been previously executed by any person, is executed in the State on or after the date of commencement of this Act  b Section 30 provides  30.- Duties by whom payable.  In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the expense of providing the proper stamp shall be borne, - a in the case of any instrument described in any of the following articles of Schedule I, namely -   f-a in case of instruments of works contract as provided in Article 63 of SCHEDULE I, by the person receiving the contract   c Section 32A provides  32A. Instrument of conveyance, etc. under valued how to be dealt with. 1 Every instrument of conveyance, exchange, gift, certificate of sale, deed of partition or power of attorney to sell immoveable property when given for consideration, deed of settlement or transfer of lease by way of assignment and also any other instruments mentioned in SCHEDULE I chargeable with duty on the basis of market value of the property, presented for registration under the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908, shall be accompanied by a true copy thereof. Provided that, in case of such instruments executed on or after the 4th July 1980, to the date of commencement of the Bombay Stamp Amendment Act, 1985, an extract of the instrument to be taken from the registration record shall be deemed to be the true copy accompanying the instrument, presented for registration for the purposes of sub-section 1.  d Section 33 provides  CHAPTER IV Instruments not duly stamped 33. Examination and impounding of instruments. 1 Subject to the provisions of section 32A, every person having by law or consent of parties authority to receive evidence, and every person in charge of a public office, except an officer of police, or any other officer, empowered by law to investigate offences under any law for the time being in force, before whom any instrument, chargeable, in his opinion, with duty, is produced or comes in the performance of his functions shall, if it appears to him that such instrument is not duly stamped, impound the same irrespective whether the instrument is or is not valid in law. 2 For that purpose every such person shall examine every instrument so chargeable and so produced or coming before him in order to ascertain whether it is stamped with a stamp of the value and description required by the law for the time being in force in the State when such instrument was executed or first executed Provided that a nothing herein contained shall be deemed to require any Magistrate or Judge of Criminal Court to examine or impound, if he does not think fit so to do, any instrument coming before him in the course of any proceeding other than a proceeding under Chapter IX or Part D of Chapter X of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 b in the case of a Judge of a High Court, the duty of examining and impounding any instrument under this section may be delegated to such officer as the Court appoints in this behalf. Section 33 casts a statutory obligation on every person empowered by law, or holding a public office, or a person who by consent of parties which would include an arbitrator is empowered to receive evidence, to examine the instrument presented before him, and ascertain whether the instrument is duly stamped. This would include the court being an authority empowered to receive an instrument in evidence. In view of the statutory interdict, the bar against the admissibility of an unstamped instrument, is absolute in nature, including for a collateral purpose.17 The phrase duly stamped implies that the instrument must be stamped with the requisite amount of duty determined in accordance with the Schedule to the Act.18 If it is found that the instrument is not stamped, or inadequately stamped, it is mandated by law to impound the instrument, and deal with it in accordance with provisions of the Stamp Act. e Section 34 operates as a statutory bar from receiving any instrument in evidence, or relying on it for any purpose whatsoever, or being acted upon, or registered, or authenticated, by any such person or public officer, unless the instrument is duly stamped. Section 34 provides 34. Instruments not duly stamped inadmissible in evidence, etc.No instrument chargeable with duty shall be admitted in evidence for any purpose by any person having by law or consent of parties authority to receive evidence, or shall be acted upon, registered or authenticated by any such person or by any public officer unless such instrument is duly stamped or if the instrument is written on sheet of paper with impressed stamp such stamp paper is purchased in the name of one of the parties to the instrument Provided that 17 Avinash Kumar Chauhan v. Vijay Krishna Mishra, 2009 2 SCC 532. 18 Black Pearl Hotels P Ltd. v. Planet M. Retail Ltd., 2017 4 SCC 498. a any such instrument shall, subject to all just exceptions, be admitted in evidence on payment of i the duty with which the same is chargeable, or in the case of an instrument insufficiently stamped, the amount required to make up such duty, and ii a penalty at the rate of 2 per cent of the deficient portion of the stamp duty for every month or part thereof, from the date of execution of such instrument Provided that, in no case, the amount of the penalty shall exceed double the deficient portion of the stamp duty. b where a contract or agreement of any kind is effected by correspondence consisting of two or more letters and any one of the letters bears the proper stamp the contract or agreement shall be deemed to be duly stamped c nothing herein contained shall prevent the admission of any instrument in evidence in any proceeding in a Criminal Court, other than a proceeding under Chapter IX or Part D of Chapter X of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 d nothing herein contained shall prevent the admission of any instrument in any court when such instrument has been executed by or on behalf of the Government or where it bears the certificate of the Collector as provided by Section 32 or any other provision of this Act e nothing herein contained shall prevent the admission of a copy of any instrument or of an oral admission of the contents of any instrument, if the stamp duty or a deficient portion of the stamp duty and penalty as specified in clause a is paid. f Section 35 provides that 35. Admission of instrument where not to be questioned.Where an instrument has been admitted in evidence, such admission shall not, except as provided in section 58, be called in question at any stage of the same suit or proceeding on the ground that the instrument has not been duly stamped. g Section 36 provides that 36. Admission of improperly stamped instruments.The State Government may make rules providing that, where an instrument bears a stamp of sufficient amount but of improper description, it may, on payment of the duty with which the same is chargeable, be certified to be duly stamped, and any instrument so certified shall then be deemed to have been duly stamped as from the date of its execution. h Section 37 provides that 37. Instruments impounded how dealt with.- 1 When the person impounding an instrument under section 33 has by law or consent of parties authority to receive evidence and admits such instrument in evidence upon payment of a penalty as provided by section 34 or of duty as provided by section 36, he shall send to the Collector an authenticated copy of such instrument, together with a certificate in writing, stating the amount of duty and penalty levied in respect thereof, and shall send such amount to the Collector, or to such person as he may appoint in this behalf. 2 In every other case, a person so impounding the original instrument shall prepare an authentic copy of such instrument and where it is a true copy or an abstract referred to in section 31 or true copy referred to in section 33A, he shall send such authentic copy or, the true copy or, as the case may be, an abstract to the Collector, for the purpose of taking action on the authentic copy or a true copy or, as the case may be, an abstract as if it were the original instrument and endorsing thereon a certificate with reference to the instrument under clause a of sub-section 1 of section 39 or under sub-section 1 of section 41, as the case may be. On receipt of the authentic copy, the true copy or, as the case may be, an abstract with the certificate as aforesaid endorsed thereon, the person who has impounded the original instrument shall copy on the original instrument the certificate endorsed on the authentic copy and shall authenticate such certificate and where it is a true copy or an abstract on which the certificate as aforesaid is endorsed, the registering officer who has forwarded the true copy or an abstract shall make appropriate entries in respect of the instrument of which it was a true copy or an abstract, in the relevant register maintained by him and on an application made in this behalf issue under his signature a certificate to the effect that the proper duty or, as the case may be, the proper duty and penalty stating the amount of each have been levied in respect of that instrument, and the name and residence of the person paying such duty and penalty. Once the duty and penalty, if any leviable under Schedule I is paid on the instrument, and the instrument is duly endorsed by the Collector, the instrument shall be admissible in evidence, and acted upon as provided by Section 41 of the Maharashtra Stamp Act. i Section 41 provides   41. Endorsement of instruments on which duty has been paid under section 34, 39 or 40  1 When the duty and penalty if any leviable in respect of any instrument not being any instrument referred to in sub-section 1 of section 32A, have been paid under section 34, section 39 or section 40, the person admitting such instrument in evidence or the Collector, as the case may be, shall certify by endorsement thereon that the proper duty or, as the case may be, the proper duty and penalty stating the amount of each have been levied in respect thereof, and the name and residence of the person paying them. 2 Subject to the provisions of section 53A, every instrument so endorsed shall thereupon be admissible in evidence, and may be registered and acted upon and authenticated as if it had been duly stamped, and shall be delivered on the application in this behalf, to the person who produced it or to the person from whose possession it came into the hands of the Officer impounding it, or to any other person according to the directions of such person Provided that  a no instrument which has been admitted in evidence upon payment of duty and a penalty under section 34, shall be so delivered before the expiration of one month from the date of such impounding, or if the Collector has certified that its further detention is necessary and has not cancelled such certificate b nothing in this section shall affect the provisions of rule 9 of Order XIII in Schedule I of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. j Section 58 provides that  58. Revision of certain decisions of Courts regarding the sufficiency of stamps. 1 When any Court in the exercise of its civil or revenue jurisdiction or any Criminal Court in any proceeding under Chapter IX or Part D of Chapter X of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, makes any order admitting any instrument in evidence as duly stamped or as not requiring a stamp, or upon payment of duty and a penalty under section 34, the Court to which appeals lie from, or reference are made by, such first mentioned Court may, of its own motion or on the application of the Collector, take such order into consideration. 2 If such Court, after such consideration is of opinion that such instrument should not have been admitted in evidence without the payment of duty and penalty under section 34, or without the payment of a higher duty and penalty than those paid, it may record a declaration to that effect, and determine the amount of duty with which such instrument is chargeable, and may require,- i. the party or person concerned to make the payment of the proper duty or the amount required to make up the same, together with a penalty under section 34, or payment of a higher duty and penalty than those paid, to itself or to the Collector and ii. any person in whose possession or power such instrument then is, to produce the same, and may impound the same when produced. 3 When any declaration has been recorded under sub-section 2, the Court recording the same shall send a copy thereof to the Collector, and, where the instrument to which it relates has been impounded or is otherwise in the possession of such Court, shall also send him such instrument. 3A When the duty and penalty leviable in respect of any instrument in accordance with, the declaration made under sub -section 3 and required to be paid thereunder are paid to the Court or to the Collector, then the Court or, as the case may be, the Collector shall certify by endorsement thereon that the proper duty and penalty, stating the amount of each, have been le-vied in respect of such instrument, and the name and residence of the person paying the same. 3B Every instrument so endorsed shall thereupon be delivered, on an application in this behalf, to the person from whose possession the instrument came in the possession of such Court, or as such person may direct, to any other person authorised by him. 4 The Collector may thereupon, notwithstanding anything contained in the order admitting such instrument in evidence, or in any certificate granted under section 41, or in section 42, prosecute any person for any offence against the stamp law which the Collector considers him to have committed in respect of such instrument Provided that  a no such prosecution shall be instituted where the amount including duty and penalty, which, according to the determination of such Court, was payable in respect of the instrument under section 34 ,is paid to the Court or the Collector, unless the Collector thinks that the offence was committed with an intention of evading payment of the proper duty b except for the purposes of such prosecution no declaration made under this section shall affect the validity of any order admitting any instrument in evidence or of any certificate granted under section 41. k Item No. 63 of Schedule I of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958 provides that  Description of instruments Proper Stamp Duty 63 WORKS CONTRACT, that is to say, a contract for works and labour or services involving transfer of property in goods whether as goods or in some other form in its execution and includes a sub-contract,- a where the amount or value set forth in Five hundred rupees such contract does not exceed rupees ten lakh. b where it exceeds rupees ten lakh. Five hundred rupees plus 0.1 per cent. of the amount above rupees ten lakh subject to maximum of rupees twenty-five lakhs 5.4 The Stamp Act is a fiscal measure enacted to secure the revenue of the State on certain classes of instruments specified in Schedule I of the Act. The stringent provisions of the Stamp Act have been framed to protect the interest of the revenue of the State. Section 34 of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958 operates as a statutory bar to an unstamped instrument being admitted in evidence, or being acted upon, for any purpose, by any authority having by law or consent of parties, the power to receive evidence, unless such instrument is duly stamped. The proviso to Section 34 states that upon payment of the requisite stamp duty, the instrument may be admitted in evidence. The words for any purpose occurring in the Indian Stamp Act was interpreted by the Privy Council in Ram Rattan v. Parma Nand,19 wherein it was held   That the words for any purpose in Section 35 of the Stamp Act, should be given their natural meaning and effect and would include a collateral purpose and that an unstamped partition deed cannot be used to corroborate the oral evidence for the purposes of determining even the factum of partition as distinct from its terms. 5.5 Section 411 of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958 provides that after the instrument is duly stamped, it would be endorsed by the Collector. Once the object of payment of Stamp Duty is satisfied, the party making a claim on the basis of that instrument, will not be defeated, on the ground of the initial defect or irregularity. Section 412 of the said Act provides that upon payment of Stamp Duty and endorsement by the concerned Collector, the defect of admissibility and legality of such instrument would stand cured. 19 1945-46 73 IA 28 AIR 1946 PC 51. 5.6 This Court in SMS Tea Estates Pvt. Ltd. v. Ms. Chandmari Tea Co. Pvt. Ltd.20 considered the issue whether an arbitration agreement in an unregistered and unstamped lease deed, which required compulsory registration under Sections 17 and 19 of the Registration Act 1908, was valid and enforceable, being a part of the said lease deed which was invalid and unenforceable. A two-judge bench of this Court considered the following two issues  i Whether an arbitration agreement contained in an unregistered but compulsorily registerable instrument is valid and enforceable? ii Whether an arbitration agreement in an unregistered instrument which is not duly stamped, is valid and enforceable? With respect to the first issue, the Court held as follows  11. Section 49 makes it clear that a document which is compulsorily registerable, if not registered, will not affect the immovable property comprised therein in any manner. It will also not be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property, except for two limited purposes. First is as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance. Second is as evidence of any collateral transaction which by itself is not required to be effected by registered instrument. A collateral transaction is not the transaction affecting the immovable property, but a transaction which is incidentally connected with that transaction. The question is whether a provision for arbitration in an unregistered document which is compulsorily registerable is a collateral transaction, in respect of which such unregistered document can be received as evidence under the proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act. 12. When a contract contains an arbitration agreement, it is a collateral term relating to the resolution of disputes, unrelated to the performance of the contract. It is as if two contractsone in regard to the substantive terms of the main contract and the other relating to resolution of disputeshad been rolled into one, for purposes of convenience. An arbitration clause is therefore an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract or the instrument. Resultantly, even if the contract or its performance is terminated or comes to an end on account of repudiation, frustration or breach of contract, the arbitration agreement would survive for the purpose of resolution of disputes arising under or in connection with the contract. 202011 14 SCC 66. Followed in Naina Thakkar v. Annapurna Builders, 2013 14 SCC 354. 13. Similarly, when an instrument or deed of transfer or a document affecting immovable property contains an arbitration agreement, it is a collateral term relating to resolution of disputes, unrelated to the transfer or transaction affecting the immovable property. It is as if two documentsone affecting the immovable property requiring registration and the other relating to resolution of disputes which is not compulsorily registerableare rolled into a single instrument. Therefore, even if a deed of transfer of immovable property is challenged as not valid or enforceable, the arbitration agreement would remain unaffected for the purpose of resolution of disputes arising with reference to the deed of transfer.  16. An arbitration agreement does not require registration under the Registration Act. Even if it is found as one of the clauses in a contract or instrument, it is an independent agreement to refer the disputes to arbitration, which is independent of the main contract or instrument. Therefore having regard to the proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act read with Section 161a of the Act, an arbitration agreement in an unregistered but compulsorily registerable document can be acted upon and enforced for the purpose of dispute resolution by arbitration. With respect to a contract or instrument which is voidable at the option of a party as by way of illustration uS. 19 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 in paragraph 15 of the judgment, it was held that the invalidity which attaches itself to the main agreement, may also attach itself to the arbitration agreement, if the reasons which make the main agreement voidable, exist in relation to the making of the arbitration agreement also. Paragraph 15 reads as follows  15. But where the contract or instrument is voidable at the option of a party as for example under Section 19 of the Contract Act, 1872, the invalidity that attaches itself to the main agreement may also attach itself to the arbitration agreement, if the reasons which make the main agreement voidable, exist in relation to the making of the arbitration agreement also. For example, if a person is made to sign an agreement to sell his property under threat of physical harm or threat to life, and the said person repudiates the agreement on that ground, not only the agreement for sale, but any arbitration agreement therein will not be binding. With respect to the second issue of whether an arbitration agreement in an unstamped contract can be acted upon, it was held as follows  19. Having regard to Section 35 of the Stamp Act, unless the stamp duty and penalty due in respect of the instrument is paid, the court cannot act upon the instrument, which means that it cannot act upon the arbitration agreement also which is part of the instrument. Section 35 of the Stamp Act is distinct and different from Section 49 of the Registration Act in regard to an unregistered document. Section 35 of the Stamp Act, does not contain a proviso like Section 49 of the Registration Act enabling the instrument to be used to establish a collateral transaction.  21. Therefore, when a lease deed or any other instrument is relied upon as contending the arbitration agreement, the court should consider at the outset, whether an objection in that behalf is raised or not, whether the document is properly stamped. If it comes to the conclusion that it is not properly stamped, it should be impounded and dealt with in the manner specified in Section 38 of the Stamp Act. The court cannot act upon such a document or the arbitration clause therein. But if the deficit duty and penalty is paid in the manner set out in Section 35 or Section 40 of the Stamp Act, the document can be acted upon or admitted in evidence. emphasis supplied 5.7 The judgment in SMS Tea Estates was passed on an application filed uS. 11 of the Arbitration Act, for reference of disputes to arbitration prior to the 2016 Amendment being passed. At that time, the law as it prevailed, as expounded in the Constitution Bench decision in SBP  Co. v. Patel Engineering Ltd.21, and other cases like National Insurance Co. v. Boghara Polyfab22, Master Construction Company v. Union of India23 etc. held that at the pre-reference stage in an application uS. 116, the Court may determine certain threshold issues, such as whether the claim was time-barred, a stale claim, or whether there had been accord and satisfaction, which would preclude the necessity of reference to arbitration. 5.8 Section 11 was amended by the 2016 Amendment Act, which inserted clause 6A, which now provides that notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any Court, the examination would be confined only to the existence of an arbitration agreement. The amendment of 2016 legislatively overruled the position with respect to the jurisdiction uS. 11 of 21 2005 8 SCC 618. 22 2009 1 SCC 267. 23 2011 12 SCC 357. the Arbitration Act, and confined the examination only to the existence of an arbitration agreement. In Duro Felguera v. Gangavaram Port Ltd.24 it was held that the legislative intent was clear that at the pre-reference stage, there must be minimal judicial intervention, and the only issue to be decided would be the existence of the arbitration agreement, and nothing more. This position was affirmed by a three-judge bench in Mayavati Trading Private Limited v. Pradyuat Deb Burman.25 5.9 The issue whether an arbitration clause in a document  agreement  conveyance which requires compulsorily to be stamped under the relevant Stamp Act, but is not duly stamped, would be enforceable after the insertion of clause 6A in Section 11, came up for consideration before a two-judge bench of this Court in Garware Wall Ropes Ltd. supra. In Garware Wall Ropes Limited supra, the Court held as under 19. It will be seen that neither in the Statement of Objects and Reasons nor in the Law Commission Report is there any mention of SMS Tea Estates. This is for the very good reason that the Supreme Court or the High Court, while deciding a Section 11 application, does not, in any manner, decide any preliminary question that arises between the parties. The Supreme Court or the High Court is only giving effect to the provisions of a mandatory enactment which, no doubt, is to protect revenue. SMS Tea Estates has taken account of the mandatory provisions contained in the Stamp Act and held them applicable to judicial authorities, which would include the Supreme Court and the High Court acting under Section 11. A close look at Section 116-A would show that when the Supreme Court or the High Court considers an application under Sections 114 to 116, and comes across an arbitration clause in an agreement or conveyance which is unstamped, it is enjoined by the provisions of the Stamp Act to first impound the agreement or conveyance and see that stamp duty and penalty if any is paid before the agreement, as a whole, can be acted upon. It is important to remember that the Stamp Act applies to the agreement or conveyance as a whole. Therefore, it is not possible to bifurcate the arbitration clause contained in such agreement or conveyance so as to give it an independent existence, as has been contended for by the respondent. The independent existence that could be given for certain limited purposes, on a harmonious reading of the Registration Act, 1908 and the 1996 Act has been referred to 24 2017 9 SCC 729. 25 2019 8 SCC 714. by Raveendran, J. in SMS Tea Estates when it comes to an unregistered agreement or conveyance. However, the Stamp Act, containing no such provision as is contained in Section 49 of the Registration Act, 1908, has been held by the said judgment to apply to the agreement or conveyance as a whole, which would include the arbitration clause contained therein. It is clear, therefore, that the introduction of Section 116-A does not, in any manner, deal with or get over the basis of the judgment in SMS Tea Estates, which continues to apply even after the amendment of Section 116-A.  22. When an arbitration clause is contained in a contract, it is significant that the agreement only becomes a contract if it is enforceable by law. We have seen how, under the Stamp Act, an agreement does not become a contract, namely, that it is not enforceable in law, unless it is duly stamped. Therefore, even a plain reading of Section 116-A, when read with Section 72 of the 1996 Act and Section 2h of the Contract Act, would make it clear that an arbitration clause in an agreement would not exist when it is not enforceable by law. This is also an indicator that SMS Tea Estates has, in no manner, been touched by the amendment of Section 116-A.  29. This judgment in Hyundai Engg. case United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Hyundai Engg.  Construction Co. Ltd., 2018 17 SCC 607  2019 2 SCC Civ 530 is important in that what was specifically under consideration was an arbitration clause which would get activated only if an insurer admits or accepts liability. Since on facts it was found that the insurer repudiated the claim, though an arbitration clause did exist, so to speak, in the policy, it would not exist in law, as was held in that judgment, when one important fact is introduced, namely, that the insurer has not admitted or accepted liability. Likewise, in the facts of the present case, it is clear that the arbitration clause that is contained in the sub-contract would not exist as a matter of law until the sub-contract is duly stamped, as has been held by us above. The argument that Section 116-A deals with existence, as opposed to Section 8, Section 16 and Section 45, which deal with validity of an arbitration agreement is answered by this Courts understanding of the expression existence in Hyundai Engg. case United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Hyundai Engg.  Construction Co. Ltd., 2018 17 SCC 607  2019 2 SCC Civ 530 , as followed by us. . 37. One reasonable way of harmonising the provisions contained in Sections 33 and 34 of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, which is a general statute insofar as it relates to safeguarding revenue, and Section 1113 of the 1996 Act, which applies specifically to speedy resolution of disputes by appointment of an arbitrator expeditiously, is by declaring that while proceeding with the Section 11 application, the High Court must impound the instrument which has not borne stamp duty and hand it over to the authority under the Maharashtra Stamp Act, who will then decide issues qua payment of stamp duty and penalty if any as expeditiously as possible, and preferably within a period of 45 days from the date on which the authority receives the instrument. As soon as stamp duty and penalty if any are paid on the instrument, any of the parties can bring the instrument to the notice of the High Court, which will then proceed to expeditiously hear and dispose of the Section 11 application. This will also ensure that once a Section 11 application is allowed and an arbitrator is appointed, the arbitrator can then proceed to decide the dispute within the time-frame provided by Section 29- A of the 1996 Act. emphasis supplied 6 We have carefully perused the provisions of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958 and Schedule I appended thereto, which enlists the instruments specified in Section 3, on which stamp duty is chargeable. We find that an arbitration agreement is not included in the Schedule as an instrument chargeable to Stamp Duty. Item 12 of Schedule I to the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958 includes an Award passed by an arbitrator to be chargeable for payment of Stamp Duty, which reads as follows Description of Instrument Proper Stamp Duty 12. AWARD, that is to say, any decision in writing by an arbitrator or umpire, not being an award directing a partition, on a reference made otherwise than by an order of the Court in the course of a suit- a where the amount of value of the property to which The same duty as a Bond the award relates as set forth in such award does not No. 15 for such amount. exceed Rs. 1,000 b in any other case Five rupees. Exemption Award under the Bombay District Municipal Act, 1873, section 81, or the Bombay Hereditary Offices Act, 1874, section 18. In Shriram EPC Limited v. Rioglass Solar SA,26 this Court held that the payment of Stamp Duty is applicable to awards made in India, but does not include a foreign award which has not been included in the Schedule to the Stamp Act, 1899. 6.1 The issue which has arisen in the present case is whether the arbitration agreement incorporated in the unstamped Work Order dated 26 2018 18 SCC 313. 28.09.2015, would also be legally unenforceable, till such time that the Work Order is subjected to payment of Stamp Duty. Undisputedly, the Work Order is chargeable to payment of Stamp Duty under Item No. 63 of the First Schedule to the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958. 6.2 In our view, the non-payment or deficiency of Stamp Duty on the Work Order does not invalidate the main contract. Section 34 provides that an unstamped instrument would not be admissible in evidence, or be acted upon, till the requisite stamp duty is paid. This would amount only to a deficiency, which can be cured on the payment of the requisite stamp duty. 6.3 The point for consideration is whether the non-payment of Stamp Duty on the Work Order, would render the arbitration clause invalid, non- existent, or unenforceable in law, till the stamp duty is paid on the substantive commercial contract. 6.4 The arbitration agreement contained in the Work Order is independent and distinct from the underlying commercial contract. The arbitration agreement is an agreement which provides the mode of dispute resolution. Section 3 of the Maharashtra Stamp Act does not subject an arbitration agreement to payment of Stamp Duty, unlike various other agreements enlisted in the Schedule to the Act. This is for the obvious reason that an arbitration agreement is an agreement to resolve disputes arising out of a commercial agreement, through the mode of arbitration. On the basis of the doctrine of separability, the arbitration agreement being a separate and distinct agreement from the underlying commercial contract, would survive independent of the substantive contract. The arbitration agreement would not be rendered invalid, un-enforceable or non-existent, even if the substantive contract is not admissible in evidence, or cannot be acted upon on account of non-payment of Stamp Duty. 6.5 A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Hindustan Steel Limited v. Ms. Dilip Construction Company27 held that  4. The award, which is an instrument within the meaning of the Stamp Act was required to be stamped. Being unstamped, the award could not be received in evidence by the Court, nor could it be acted upon. But the Court was competent to impound it and to send it to the Collector with a certificate in writing stating the amount of duty and penalty levied thereon. On the instrument so received the Collector may adjudge whether it is duly stamped and he may require penalty to be paid thereon, if in his view it has not been duly stamped. If the duty and penalty are paid, the Collector will certify by endorsement on the instrument that the proper duty and penalty have been paid. 5. An instrument which is not duly stamped cannot be received in evidence by any person who has authority to receive evidence, and it cannot be acted upon by that person or by any public officer. Section 35 provides that the admissibility of an instrument once admitted in evidence shall not, except as provided in Section 61, be called in question at any stage of the same suit or proceeding on the ground that the instrument has not been duly stamped. 6. Relying upon the difference in the phraseology between Sections 35 and 36 it was urged that an instrument which is not duly stamped may be admitted in evidence on payment of duty and penalty, but it cannot be acted upon because Section 35 operates as a bar to the admission in evidence of the instrument not duly stamped as well as to its being acted upon, and the Legislature has by Section 36 in the conditions set out therein removed the bar only against admission in evidence of the instrument. The argument ignores the true import of Section 36. By that section an instrument once admitted in evidence shall not be called in question at any stage of the same suit or proceeding on the ground that it has not been duly stamped. Section 36 does not prohibit a challenge against an instrument that it shall not be acted upon because it is not duly stamped, but on that account there is no bar against an instrument not duly stamped being acted upon after payment of the stamp duty and penalty according to the procedure prescribed by the Act. The doubt, if any, is removed by the terms of Section 422 which enact, in terms unmistakable, that every instrument endorsed by the Collector under Section 421 shall be admissible in evidence and may be acted upon as if it has been duly stamped. 7. The Stamp Act is a fiscal measure enacted to secure revenue for the State on certain classes of instruments It is not enacted to arm a litigant with a weapon of technicality to meet the case of his opponent. The stringent provisions of the Act are conceived in the interest of the revenue once that object is secured according to law, the party staking his claim on the instrument will not be defeated on the ground of the initial defect in the 27 1969 1 SCC 597. instrument. Viewed in that light the scheme is clear. Section 35 of the Stamp Act operates as a bar to an unstamped instrument being admitted in evidence or being acted upon Section 40 provides the procedure for instruments being impounded, sub-section 1 of Section 42 provides for certifying that an instrument is duly stamped, and sub-section 2 of Section 42 enacts the consequences resulting from such certification. emphasis supplied 6.6 In our view, there is no legal impediment to the enforceability of the arbitration agreement, pending payment of Stamp Duty on the substantive contract. The adjudication of the rights and obligations under the Work Order or the substantive commercial contract would however not proceed before complying with the mandatory provisions of the Stamp Act. 6.7 The Stamp Act is a fiscal enactment for payment of stamp duty to the State on certain classes of instruments specified in the Stamp Act. Section 40 of the Indian Stamp Act,1899 provides the procedure for instruments which have been impounded, and sub-section 1 of Section 42 requires the instrument to be endorsed after it is duly stamped by the concerned Collector. Section 422 provides that after the document is duly stamped, it shall be admissible in evidence, and may be acted upon. 6.8 In our view, the decision in SMS Tea Estates does not lay down the correct position in law on two issues i.e. i that an arbitration agreement in an unstamped commercial contract cannot be acted upon, or is rendered un-enforceable in law and ii that an arbitration agreement would be invalid where the contract or instrument is voidable at the option of a party, such as uS. 19 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. We hold that since the arbitration agreement is an independent agreement between the parties, and is not chargeable to payment of stamp duty, the non-payment of stamp duty on the commercial contract, would not invalidate the arbitration clause, or render it un-enforceable, since it has an independent existence of its own. The view taken by the Court on the issue of separability of the arbitration clause on the registration of the substantive contract, ought to have been followed even with respect to the Stamp Act. The non-payment of stamp duty on the substantive contract would not invalidate even the main contract. It is a deficiency which is curable on the payment of the requisite Stamp Duty. 6.9 The second issue in SMS Tea Estates that a voidable contract would not be arbitrable as it affects the validity of the arbitration agreement, is in our view not the correct position in law. The allegations made by a party that the substantive contract has been obtained by coercion, fraud, or misrepresentation has to be proved by leading evidence on the issue. These issues can certainly be adjudicated through arbitration. We overrule the judgment in SMS Tea Estates with respect to the aforesaid two issues as not laying down the correct position in law. 6.10 The Garware judgment has followed the judgment in SMS Tea Estates. The Counsel for the Appellant has placed reliance on paragraph 22 of the judgment to contend that the arbitration clause would be non- existent in law, and unenforceable, till Stamp Duty is adjudicated and paid on the substantive contract. We hold that this finding is erroneous, and does not lay down the correct position in law. We have already held that an arbitration agreement is distinct and independent from the underlying substantive commercial contract. Once the arbitration agreement is held to have an independent existence, it can be acted upon, irrespective of the alleged invalidity of the commercial contract. 6.11 We notice that the judgment in Garware Wall Ropes Limited has been cited with approval by a co-ordinate bench of this Court in Vidya Drolia  Ors. v. Durga Trading Corporation.28 Paragraph 92 of the judgment reads thus  92. We now proceed to examine the question, whether the word existence in Section 11 merely refers to contract formation whether there is an arbitration agreement and excludes the question of enforcement validity and therefore the latter falls outside the jurisdiction of the court at the referral stage. On jurisprudentially and textualism it is possible to differentiate between existence of an arbitration agreement and validity of an arbitration agreement. Such interpretation can draw support from the plain meaning of the word existence. However, it is equally possible, jurisprudentially and on contextualism, to hold that an agreement has no existence if it is not enforceable and not binding. Existence of an arbitration agreement presupposes a valid agreement which would be enforced by the court by relegating the parties to arbitration. Legalistic and plain meaning interpretation would be contrary to the contextual background including the definition clause and would result in unpalatable consequences. A reasonable and just interpretation of existence requires understanding the context, the purpose and the relevant legal norms applicable for a binding and enforceable arbitration agreement. An agreement evidenced in writing has no meaning unless the parties can be compelled to adhere and abide by the terms. A party cannot sue and claim rights based on an unenforceable document. Thus, there are good reasons to hold that an arbitration agreement exists only when it is valid and legal. A void and unenforceable understanding is no agreement to do anything. Existence of an arbitration agreement means an arbitration agreement that meets and satisfies the statutory requirements of both the Arbitration Act and the Contract Act and when it is enforceable in law. We would proceed to elaborate and give further reasons  i In Garware Wall Ropes Ltd., this Court had examined the question of stamp duty in an underlying contract with an arbitration clause and in the context had drawn a distinction between the first and second part of Section 72 of the Arbitration Act, albeit the observations made and quoted above with reference to existence and validity of the arbitration agreement being apposite and extremely important, we would repeat the same by reproducing paragraph 29 thereof  29. This judgment in Hyundai Engg. case is important in that what was specifically under consideration was an arbitration clause which would get activated only if an insurer admits or accepts liability. Since on facts it was found that the insurer repudiated the claim, though an arbitration clause did exist, so to speak, in the policy, it would not exist in law, as was held in that judgment, when one important fact is introduced, namely, that the insurer has not admitted or accepted liability. Likewise, in the facts of the present case, it is clear that the arbitration clause that is contained in the 28 Delivered on 14.12.2020 in C.A. No. 2402  2019. subcontract would not exist as a matter of law until the sub-contract is duly stamped, as has been held by us above. The argument that Section 116A deals with existence, as opposed to Section 8, Section 16 and Section 45, which deal with validity of an arbitration agreement is answered by this Courts understanding of the expression existence in Hyundai Engg. case, as followed by us. Existence and validity are intertwined, and arbitration agreement does not exist if it is illegal or does not satisfy mandatory legal requirements. Invalid agreement is no agreement. 6.12 We doubt the correctness of the view taken in paragraph 92 of the three-judge bench in Vidya Drolia. We consider it appropriate to refer the findings in paras 22 and 29 of Garware Wall Ropes Limited, which has been affirmed in paragraph 92 of Vidya Drolia, to a Constitution Bench of five judges. 7 The next issue which arises is as to which authority would exercise the power of impounding the instrument under Section 33 read with Section 34 of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, in a case where the substantive contract contains an arbitration agreement. 7.1 In an arbitration agreement, the disputes may be referred to arbitration by three modes. a The first mode is where the appointment of the arbitrator takes place by the parties consensually in accordance with the terms of the arbitration agreement, or by a designated arbitral institution, without the intervention of the court. In such a case, the arbitrator  tribunal is obligated by Section 33 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 or the applicable State Act to impound the instrument, and direct the parties to pay the requisite Stamp Duty and penalty, if any, and obtain an endorsement from the concerned Collector. This would be evident from the provisions of Section 34 of the Stamp Act which provides that any person having by law or consent of parties authority to receive evidence is mandated by law to impound the instrument, and direct the parties to pay the requisite stamp duty. b The second mode of appointment is where the parties fail to make the appointment in accordance with the arbitration agreement, and an application is filed under Section 11 before the Court to invoke the default power for making the appointment. In such a case, the High Court, or the Supreme Court, as the case may be, while exercising jurisdiction under Section 11, would impound the substantive contract which is either unstamped or inadequately stamped, and direct the parties to cure the defect before the arbitrator  tribunal can adjudicate upon the contract. c The third mode is when an application is filed under Section 8 before a judicial authority for reference of disputes to arbitration, since the subject matter of the contract is covered by an arbitration agreement. In such a case, the judicial authority will make the reference to arbitration. However, in the meanwhile, the parties would be directed to have the substantive contract stamped in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Stamp Act, so that the rights and obligations emanating from the substantive contract can be adjudicated upon. 7.2 In the case of an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 the situation would be different. If an application for urgent interim reliefs is filed under Section 9 before the Court, and it is brought to the attention of the Court that the substantive contract is not duly stamped, the Court would grant ad-interim relief to safeguard the subject-matter of the arbitration. However, the substantive contract would then be impounded, and the concerned party be directed to take the necessary steps for payment of the requisite stamp duty in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Stamp Act, within a time-bound period. It is made clear that the payment of Stamp Duty on the substantive contract as assessed by the Collector, would however be subject to the right of revision  appeal available under the relevant Stamp Act. 8 Whether the fraudulent invocation of the Bank Guarantee is arbitrable? 8.1 In the present case, the Appellant-Plaintiff in the Commercial Suit inter alia submitted that the Bank Guarantee was furnished to ensure due execution of the Work Order dated 28.09.2015. It was submitted on behalf of the Appellants that the invocation of the bank guarantee was fraudulent, since the agreement had never been acted upon. There was no invoice raised or payment received under the Work Order. In the absence of any legal liability for payment under the Work Order, the invocation of the bank guarantee was fraudulent. 8.2 The High Court held that the allegations of fraud made in this case are simple, which do not in the normal course constitute any criminal offence, nor are the allegations so complex in nature which would entail extensive evidence being led, hence the disputes could be resolved through arbitration. 8.3 Under the Arbitration Act, the earliest decision on the issue of arbitrability of allegations of fraud was considered by a two-judge bench in N. Radhakrishnan v. Maestro Engineers.29 In this case, the applicant had made serious allegations against the respondents of having committed malpractices in the account books, and manipulation of finances of the partnership firm. An application under Section 8 was filed by the respondents for reference of disputes to arbitration. The Court took the view that since the issues involved detailed investigation into the allegations and production of elaborate evidence, it could not be properly dealt by an arbitrator, and ought to be settled by a court of law. This decision relied on the judgment in Abdul Kadir v. Madhav Prabhakar,30 which was passed under the 1940 Act. The judgment in Abdul Kadir in turn relied upon an English judgment rendered in Russel v. Russel,31 wherein it was held that a party against whom an allegation of fraud is made, has the right to defend himself in a public forum. 8.4 The judgment in N. Radhakrishnan supra is based on an outdated view of the law propounded in Russel v. Russel, which ante-dates even the first English Arbitration Act of 1899. Arbitrability of fraud is no longer an issue 29 2010 1 SCC 72. Followed in Ivory Properties  Hotels Pvt. Ltd. v. Nusli Neville Wadia, 2011 2 Arb LR 479 Bom See also article by Justice D.R. Dhanuka Retd. reported in Journal Section of 2010 2 Arb LR 13 RRB Energy Ltd. v. Vestas Wind System  Ors., 2015 219 DLT 516. 30 AIR 1962 SC 406 1962 3 SCR 702. 31 1880 14 Ch. D 471. relating to the competence of the arbitrator, or dealing with voluminous evidence. Arbitrators are competent to deal with allegations of civil fraud. The judgment in Russel is obsolete, which would be evident from the various enactments of the English Arbitration Act. Under Section 242 of the 1950 Act, the court could revoke the authority of a tribunal to deal with claims involving issues of fraud. This provision was repealed by Section 1072 of the English Arbitration Act, 1996 Act. Russel in his Commentary on Arbitration observed that an arbitral tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to impose criminal sanctions on a party, its power is limited to the civil consequences of fraud.32 8.5 In Bharat Rasiklal Ashra v. Gautam Rasiklal Ashra,33 a two-judge bench took a different view by holding that at the pre-reference stage under Section 11, the court is not required to examine the allegations of fraud and forgery. The scope of examination is only the existence of a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement as a condition precedent for making a reference. The ground that allegations of fraud, forgery and fabrication are likely to involve recording of evidence, or involve some delay in disposal, were not relevant grounds to be considered at the pre-reference stage. 8.6 The legislature amended sub-section 1 of Section 8 to provide that a judicial authority shall refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that prima facie no valid agreement exists. The amended Section 8 reads  8. Power to refer parties to arbitration where there is an arbitration agreement.- 1 A judicial authority, before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party to the 32 Russel on Arbitration, Pg.72, para 2-083, and Pg.83, para 2-107. 33 2012 2 SCC 144. arbitration agreement or any person claiming through or under him, so applies not later than the date of submitting his first statement on the substance of the dispute, then, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any Court, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exists. 2  3   The issue of arbitrability of fraud was subsequently considered by a two-judge bench in A. Ayyasamy v. A. Paramasivam  Ors.34. The Court held that Section 8 mandates reference to arbitration, unless the arbitration agreement is found to be invalid. It has been recognised that certain categories of disputes which are of public nature, are not capable of adjudication and settlement by arbitration, which is a private forum constituted by consent of parties. The Court made a distinction between cases where there are allegations of serious fraud and fraud simplicitor. Mere allegations of fraud simplicitor are not a sufficient ground to decline reference to arbitration. Parties may be referred to arbitration where allegations of fraud pertain to disputes between parties inter se, and have no implication for third parties. The courts may, however, refuse to make a reference to arbitration only in those cases where there are very serious allegations of fraud, which make a virtual case of criminal offence of fraud, or where allegations of fraud are so complicated, that it becomes absolutely essential that such complex issues be decided only by the civil courts on appreciation of voluminous evidence. This would also include those cases where there are serious allegations of 34 2016 10 SCC 386. forgery or fabrication of documents, or where fraud is alleged with respect to the arbitration clause itself, or where the fraud alleged is of such a nature that it permeates the entire contract, including the agreement to arbitrate. The judicial authority must carefully sift the materials for the purpose of determining whether the defence is merely a pretext to avoid arbitration. It was opined that the Arbitration Act must be interpreted to bring it in consonance with the prevailing arbitration jurisprudence in the common law world. 8.7 The judgment in Ayyasamy supra was followed in Rashid Raza v. Sadaf Akhtar,35 wherein the twin test laid down in para 25 of Ayyasamy was followed i.e.  i does the plea of fraud permeate the entire contract and above all, the agreement of arbitration, rendering it void, or ii whether the allegations of fraud touch upon the internal affairs of the parties inter se having no implication in the public domain. 8.8 In the subsequent decision of Ameet Lalchand Shah  Ors. v. Rishabh Enterprises  Anr.,36 allegations of fraud arising from criminal breach of trust and misrepresentation regarding the equipment procured and leased for the setting up and operating of a Photovoltaic solar plant were made. A civil suit was filed praying for a declaration that all the agreements were vitiated by fraud and misrepresentation. An application was filed under Section 8 seeking reference of the disputes to arbitration under all the four agreements. This Court held that only where the court is 35 2019 8 SCC 710. 36 2018 15 SCC 678. satisfied that the allegations of fraud are serious and complicated in nature, would it be more appropriate for the court to deal with the subject matter of the disputes, rather than relegate the parties to arbitration. It is the duty of the court to impart a sense of business efficacy to commercial transactions, and mere allegations of fraud would not be sufficient to decline reference of disputes to arbitration. 8.9 In a recent judgment delivered in Avitel Post Studioz Ltd.  Ors. v. HSBC PI Holdings Mauritius Limited,37 which pertains to an international commercial contract, the issue of arbitrability of fraud arose for consideration. This Court held that the same set of facts may have civil as well criminal consequences. If it is clear that a civil dispute involves questions of fraud, misrepresentation, etc. which can be the subject matter of a proceeding under Section 17 of the Indian Contract, 1872, andor the tort of deceit, the mere fact that criminal proceedings can or have been instituted in respect of the same subject matter, would not lead to the conclusion that a dispute which is otherwise arbitrable, ceases to be so. This view has been affirmed by a co-ordinate bench in Deccan Paper Mills v. Regency Mahavir38 and Vidya Drolia  Others v. Durga Trading Corporation39. 8.10 In our view, all civil or commercial disputes, either contractual or non- contractual, which can be adjudicated upon by a civil court, in principle, can 37 2020 SCCOnLine SC 656. 38 2020 SCCOnLine SC 655. 39 Civil Appeal No.2402 of 2019 decided vide Judgment dated 14.12.2020. be adjudicated and resolved through arbitration, unless it is excluded either expressly by statute, or by necessary implication. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 does not exclude any category of disputes as being non arbitrable. Section 23 of the Arbitration Act however recognizes that certain categories of disputes by law may not be submitted to arbitration.40 In all jurisdictions, certain categories of disputes are reserved by the legislature, as a matter of public policy, to be adjudicated by a court of law, since they lie in the realm of public law. 8.11 Traditionally, disputes relating to rights in rem are required to be adjudicated by courts and  or statutory tribunals. A right in rem is a right exercisable against the world at large. Actions in rem refer to actions which create a legal status such as citizenship, divorce, testamentary and probate issues, etc. A lis in rem is not arbitrable by a private tribunal constituted by the consent of parties. Actions in personam determine the rights and interests of parties to the subject matter of the dispute, which are arbitrable. The broad categories of disputes which are considered to be non arbitrable are penal offences which are visited with criminal sanction offences pertaining to bribery  corruption matrimonial disputes relating to divorce, judicial separation, restitution of conjugal rights, child custody and guardianship matters, which pertain to the status of a person testamentary matters which pertain to disputes relating to the validity of a Will, grant of Section 23. This Part shall not affect any other law for the time being in force by virtue of which certain disputes may not be submitted to arbitration. probate, letters of administration, succession, which pertain to the status of a person, and are adjudicated by civil courts. Certain categories of disputes such as consumer disputes41 insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings oppression and mismanagement, or winding up of a company disputes relating to trusts, trustees and beneficiaries of a trust42 are governed by special enactments. This Court in Booz Allen  Hamilton Inc. v. SBI Home Finance Ltd.43 has recognized some examples of disputes which are not arbitrable, and held that  36. The well recognized examples of non-arbitrable disputes are  i disputes relating to rights and liabilities which give rise to or arise out of criminal offences ii matrimonial disputes relating to divorce, judicial separation, restitution of conjugal rights, child custody iii guardianship matters iv insolvency and winding up matters v testamentary matters grant of probate, letters of administration and succession certificate and vi eviction or tenancy matters governed by special statutes where the tenant enjoys statutory protection against eviction and only the specified courts are conferred jurisdiction to grant eviction or decide the disputes. 8.12 The civil aspect of fraud is considered to be arbitrable in contemporary arbitration jurisprudence, with the only exception being where the allegation is that the arbitration agreement itself is vitiated by fraud or fraudulent inducement, or the fraud goes to the validity of the underlying contract, and impeaches the arbitration clause itself. Another category of cases is where the substantive contract is expressly declared to be void under Section 1044 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 where the agreement is Emaar MGF Land Limited v. Aftab Singh, 2019 12 SCC 751. 42 Vimal Kishor Shah  Others v. Jayesh Dinesh Shah  Others. 2016 8 SCC 788. 43 2011 5 SCC 532. 44 Section 10. What agreements are contracts.All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void. entered into by a minor without following the procedure prescribed under the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 or a lunatic, which would be with a party incompetent to enter into a contract. 8.13 The civil aspect of fraud can be adjudicated by an arbitral tribunal. The civil aspect of fraud is defined by Section 17 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 as follows  17. Fraud defined.  Fraud means and includes any of the following acts committed by a party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent, with intent to deceive another party thereto or his agent, or to induce him to enter into the contract 1 the suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true 2 the active concealment of a fact by one having knowledge or belief of the fact 3 a promise made without any intention of performing it 4 any other act fitted to deceive 5 any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent. 8.14 We will now consider whether voidable agreements are arbitrable. Voidable agreements are defined by Section 19 of the Contract Act as  19. Voidability of agreements without free consent.When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused. A party to a contract, whose consent was caused by fraud or misrepresentation, may, if he thinks fit, insist that the contract shall be performed, and that he shall be put in the position in which he would have been if the representation made had been true. Exception.If such consent was caused by misrepresentation or by silence, fraudulent within the meaning of Section 17, the contract, nevertheless, is not voidable, if the party whose consent was so caused had the means of discovering the truth with ordinary diligence. Explanation.A fraud or misrepresentation which did not cause the consent to a contract of the party of whom such fraud was practised, or to whom such misrepresentation was made, does not render a contract voidable. Nothing herein contained shall affect any law in force in India, and not hereby expressly repealed, by which any contract is required to be made in writing or in the presence of witnesses, or any law relating to the registration of documents. Section 11. Who are competent to contract.Every person is competent to contract who is of the age of majority according to the law to which he is subject, and who is of sound mind and is not disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject. In the case of voidable agreements, such disputes would be arbitrable, since the issue whether the consent was procured by coercion, fraud, or misrepresentation requires to be adjudicated upon by leading cogent evidence, which can very well be decided through arbitration. Until it so proved and upheld as per Sections 2i and j of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 such an agreement would remain enforceable, and is not void. 8.15 In Swiss Timing Ltd. v. Commonwealth Games 2010 Organising Committee,45 a single judge exercising powers uS. 11 opined that when a plea is taken to avoid arbitration on the ground of the underlying contract being void, the court is required to ascertain the true nature of the defence. Often, the terms void and voidable are used loosely and interchangeably. The court ought to examine the plea by keeping in mind the provisions of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. In cases where the court comes to a conclusion that the contract is void without receiving any evidence, it may be justified in declining the reference to arbitration in a few isolated cases. These would be cases where the court can readily conclude that the contract is void upon a meaningful reading of the contract document itself. However, it would not be permissible to circumvent arbitration where the defence taken is that the contract is voidable, which are cases covered under circumstances mentioned inter alia in Sections 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Even though Swiss Timing Ltd. was a decision of a designate of the Chief Justice under Section 11 of the 1996 Act prior to the Amendment, and 45 2014 6 SCC 677. would have no precedential value in view of the judgment of this Court in State of West Bengal v. Associated Contractors,46 the reasoning in Swiss Timing Ltd. has been cited with approval by this Court in Avitel Post Studioz Ltd.  Ors. v. HSBC PI Holdings Mauritius Limited47. 8.16 The ground on which fraud was held to be non arbitrable earlier was that it would entail voluminous and extensive evidence, and would be too complicated to be decided in arbitration. In contemporary arbitration practice, arbitral tribunals are required to traverse through volumes of material in various kinds of disputes such as oil, natural gas, construction industry, etc. The ground that allegations of fraud are not arbitrable is a wholly archaic view, which has become obsolete, and deserves to be discarded. However, the criminal aspect of fraud, forgery, or fabrication, which would be visited with penal consequences and criminal sanctions can be adjudicated only by a court of law, since it may result in a conviction, which is in the realm of public law.48 8.17 In the present case, the allegations of fraud with respect to the invocation of the Bank Guarantee are arbitrable, since it arises out of disputes between parties inter se, and is not in the realm of public law. 9 Maintainability of the Writ Petition 9.1 We are of the view that the Writ Petition filed by the Respondent No. 1 to challenge the Order dated 18.01.2018 passed by the Special Commercial Court  District Judge-I in Commercial Dispute No. 622017 was 46 2015 1 SCC 32. 47 2020 SCCOnLine SC 656. 48 Malhotras Commentary on the Law of Arbitration, 4th ed., Wolters Kluwer 2020, p.339, Volume I. not maintainable, since a statutory remedy under the amended Section 37 of the Arbitration Act is available. Section 371 has been amended by Act 3 of 201649. Section 371a provides for an appeal to be filed against an Order refusing to refer the parties to arbitration. Section 371a reads as  37. Appealable orders.  1 An appeal shall lie from the following orders and from no others to the Court authorised by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the Court passing the order, namely- a Refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section 8  9.2 Since the judgment and order of the Commercial Court dated 18.01.2018 refusing to refer the parties to arbitration was an appealable order under Section 371a of the Arbitration Act, the Writ Petition was not maintainable. The appeal would lie before the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court under Section 131A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Section 131A read as  13. Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions.1 Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court below the level of a District Judge may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Court within a period of 60 days from the date of judgment or order. 1A Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court at the level of District Judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order Provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 5 of 1908 as amended by this Act and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 26 of 1996. 49 which came into effect on 23.10.2015. In view of the availability of a statutory remedy, the judgment of the High Court passed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution is liable to be set aside on the ground of maintainability. 10 In the present case, since both parties have admitted the existence of the arbitration agreement between the parties, as recorded in the judgment of the High Court, and even before this Court during oral submissions, parties may either appoint a sole arbitrator consensually failing which, an application uS. 11 for appointment of the arbitrator may be made before the High Court. 11 In view of the discussion hereinabove, we hold that  i The impugned judgment and order dated 30.09.2020 in W.P. No. 1801 of 2020 passed by the Bombay High Court is set aside ii We direct the Secretary General of this Court to impound the Work Order dated 28.09.2015, and forward it to the concerned Collector in Maharashtra for assessment of the Stamp Duty payable on the said instrument, to be completed within a period of 45 days from receipt of the same iii On determination of the Stamp Duty payable, the Appellant  Plaintiff is directed to make the payment assessed by the Collector uS.30f-a of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958 within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of communication of the Order The Stamp Duty assessed by the Collector will, however, be subject to the statutory right available to file a revision  appeal under the Maharashtra Stamp Act. iv With respect to the invocation of the Bank Guarantee, the Appellant may seek interim relief uS. 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. We extend the stay granted by the High Court for a further period of eight weeks. 12 We are of the considered view that the finding in SMS Tea Estates and Garware that the non-payment of stamp duty on the commercial contract would invalidate even the arbitration agreement, and render it non-existent in law, and un-enforceable, is not the correct position in law. In view of the finding in paragraph 92 of the judgment in Vidya Drolia by a co-ordinate bench, which has affirmed the judgment in Garware, the aforesaid issue is required to be authoritatively settled by a Constitution bench of this Court. We consider it appropriate to refer the following issue, to be authoritatively settled by a Constitution bench of five judges of this Court   Whether the statutory bar contained in Section 35 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 applicable to instruments chargeable to Stamp Duty under Section 3 read with the Schedule to the Act, would also render the arbitration agreement contained in such an instrument, which is not chargeable to payment of stamp duty, as being non-existent, un- enforceable, or invalid, pending payment of stamp duty on the substantive contract  instrument ?  In light of the same, the Registry may place this matter before the Honble Chief Justice of India for appropriate orders  directions. ...J. Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud ..J. Indu Malhotra .J.

Bopanna REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 7843 OF 2019 Arising out of SLP Civil No.9391 of 2019 Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd. .Appellants Versus K.S. Infraspace LLP  Anr. . Respondents JUDGMENT A.S. Bopanna,J. Leave granted. 2. The appellant herein is the plaintiff in Commercial Court Suit No. 412018 filed before the Commercial Court at Vadodara. The respondents herein are arrayed as the defendants to the suit. The respondents on being notified in the suit had appeared and filed the written statement inter alia contending that the suit is not maintainable as the dispute involved cannot be termed as a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section 21c of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 CC Act, 2015 for short. In view of such contention, the respondents herein also filed an application under Order VII Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking an order to return the plaint to be presented in the Court in which the suit should have been instituted. The appellant herein though did not choose to file objection to the said application, had however opposed the same. The application was registered as Exhibit 15 and the learned Judge of the Commercial Court on consideration had through the order dated 17.10.2018 rejected the application. The respondents herein claiming to be aggrieved by the said order had approached the High Court of Gujarat in RSpecial Civil Application No.178682018. The High Court through a detailed order dated 01.03.2019 has allowed the petition, set aside the order dated 17.10.2018 passed by the Commercial Court, Vadodara and on allowing the application filed under Order VII Rule 10 CPC directed that the plaint be returned to the appellant herein to be presented in the Court in which the suit should have been instituted. The appellant herein, therefore, claiming to be aggrieved by the order dated 01.03.2019 is before this Court in this appeal. 3. The brief facts which led to the present situation is that the appellant herein executed an agreement to sell dated 14.02.2012 in favour of the respondent No. 2 in respect of the land which is described in the agreement. The respondent No. 2 assigned and transferred all his rights under the said agreement to sell in favour of respondent No.1 by executing an assignment deed dated 12.10.2017. In that view, the respondent No. 1 herein was to purchase the lands which were the subject matter of the agreement from the appellant herein. Accordingly, the sale was made under a Deed of Conveyance dated 03.11.2017. Since certain other aspects were to be completed regarding the change relating to the nature of the use of the land for conclusion of the transaction, the right of the appellant in respect of the land was to be protected. In that view a Memorandum of Understanding dated 03.11.2017 was entered into between the appellant and the respondents herein. As per the same, a Mortgage Deed was required to be executed by respondent No. 1 herein in favour of the appellant. 4. Accordingly, a Mortgage Deed dated 03.11.2017 was executed but the same had not been registered. It is in that light the appellant herein filed the Commercial Civil Suit No. 412018 so as to enforce the execution of a Mortgage Deed. Consequently, the relief of permanent injunction and other related reliefs were sought. It is in the said suit, summon was issued to respondents herein who are the defendants in the suit, wherein on filing the written statement the application under Order VII Rule 10 of CPC was filed. The Commercial Court while rejecting the application had referred to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the appellant company and in that light taking note of the business that they were entitled to undertake has arrived at the conclusion that the plaintiff seems to be carrying on the business as an estate agent and in that circumstance has further arrived at its conclusion that it is a commercial dispute. The High Court on the other hand had found fault with the manner in which the Commercial Court had rested its consideration on the Memorandum and Articles of Association and had examined the matter in detail to come to a conclusion that the immovable property in the instant case was not being used for trade or commerce. In that regard, the legal position enunciated by the various decisions was referred to and had accordingly directed the return of the plaint to be presented in an appropriate Court which is assailed herein. 5. We have heard Shri Dhruv Mehta, learned senior advocate for the appellant, Shri Deven Parikh, learned senior advocate for the respondents and perused the appeal papers. 6. At the outset, it is noticed that the consideration required in the instant case is as to whether the transaction between the parties herein which is the subject matter of the suit could be considered as a commercial dispute so as to enable the Commercial Court to entertain the suit. In that regard, it is necessary to take note of Section 21cvii of the CC Act, 2015. The said provision to the extent relevant is extracted here below for reference. Sec.21 In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,- a xxx b xxx c commercial dispute means a dispute arising out of  i xxx ii xxx iii xxx iv xxx v xxx vi xxx vii agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce viii xxx ix xxx x xxx xi xxx xii xxx xiii xxx xiv xxx xv xxx xvi xxx xvii xxx xviii xxx xix xxx xx xxx xxi xxx xxii xxx From a perusal, of the provision relied upon by the learned senior advocates it is noticed that the disputes arising out of agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce will qualify to be a commercial dispute to be tried by Commercial Courts. The question therefore would be that, in the instant case though the parties have entered into a sale transaction of the immovable property and presently in the suit the registration of a Mortgage Deed pertaining to the immovable property is sought, whether the immovable property involved could be considered as being used exclusively in trade or commerce. 7. The learned senior advocate for the appellant has made detailed submissions referring to the documents to contend that the appellant was running an industry in the land concerned which was acquired for that purpose and presently the respondent No.1 has purchased the same for developing the said land and in that view the land is one which is used for trade and commerce. The learned senior advocate for the respondents on the other hand has contended to the contrary that the appellant had ceased to function for the past several years and the company being defunct, the land involved was not being used for trade or commerce and even though the respondent No.1 has sought for change of land use and to develop the land, the same would be subject to such change of land use that would be granted and the use to which it would be put in future. Hence it is contended that as on the date of transaction the land is not being used for trade or commerce and a suit at present would not be maintainable before the Commercial Court. 8. Though such rival contentions are put forth by the learned senior advocate on either side, these aspects cannot be dealt with in abstract. Instead the nature of the dispute and the jurisdiction to try the same is to be reflected in the suit itself since in a civil suit the pleadings, namely averments in the plaint would at the outset be relevant to confer jurisdiction. Hence before adverting to the other aspects it would be necessary to carefully examine the plaint. The plaintiff has in detail referred to the nature of the transaction between the appellant and the respondents herein. In para 5 thereof the detail of the land bearing R.S. No.122 corresponding to City Survey No.1101 and 11001 having land area of 9207 square metres at Mouje Subhanpura Reg. District, Vadodara is referred. Further the schedule of the property is indicated in para 6 and reference is made to the Memorandum of Understanding where again the reference is made to the land. It is averred therein that it would be the total responsibility of the respondent No.1 herein defendant No.2 in the suit to change the land use as well as to pay the amount that may be required for the permission. The amount to be paid as premium is referred and the right of the plaintiff to secure the Mortgage Deed in view of the terms of the MoU is stated. In the entire plaint there is no reference to the nature of the land or the type of use to which it was being put as on the date of the Agreement to SellSale DeedMemorandum of Understanding or as on the date of the suit. 9. Further on referring to the cause of action in para 21, the plaintiff has thereafter referred in para 22 to the jurisdiction of the Court to hear and decide the matter. It would be appropriate to extract the same which reads as hereunder 22. Jurisdiction The Plaintiff states that the Defendants having their office at Vadodara land which is the subject matter of the instant suit is situated within the territorial jurisdiction of this Honble Court and hence this Honble Court has the jurisdiction to hear and decide the matter. Even though in the paragraph describing jurisdiction the plaintiff has stated with regard to the territorial jurisdiction since the office and land being at Vadodara, there is no reference indicating the reason for which the plaintiff pleads that the Court which is the Commercial Court exclusively constituted to try the commercial disputes has jurisdiction to try the instant suit. In that background, a perusal of the prayer made in the plaint would essentially indicate that the suit is one seeking for specific performance of the terms of MoU whereunder it is agreed that the Mortgage Deed be executed. Even if the immovable property under the Mortgage Deed was the subject matter it was necessary to plead and indicate that the same was being used in trade or commerce due to which the jurisdiction of Commercial Court is invoked. Without such basic pleadings in the plaint, any explanations sought to be put forth subsequently would only lead to a situation that if an objection is raised, in every suit a consideration would be required based on extraneous material even to ascertain as to whether the intended transaction between the parties was of such nature that it is to be construed as a commercial dispute. 10. Be that as it may, the learned senior advocates on both sides have sought to rely on the legal position decided by the various High Courts in the absence of the pronouncement of this Court. The learned senior advocate in that regard have referred to the various decisions on the same point. However, we do not find it appropriate to refer to each of them and over burden this order since we notice that the High Court in fact has referred to various decisions while deciding the instant case and has thereafter arrived at its conclusion. The discussion as made by the High Court with reference to the various decisions is also justified. In that view, we would refer to the decision of a Division Bench in the case of Jagmohan Behl vs. State Bank of Indore, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 10706 relied on by the learned senior advocate for the appellant. In that regard, it is noticed that in the said case on taking note of the provision contained in Clause 21cvii of the CC Act, 2015 it is held that the dispute involved therein would constitute a commercial dispute and the expression arising out of and in relation to immovable property should not be given the narrow and restricted meaning and the expression would include all matters relating agreements in connection with the immovable properties. The said conclusion reached was in a circumstance where the immovable property in question was undoubtedly being used for a trade or commerce and it was held so when the claim in the suit is for recovery of rent or mesne profit, security deposit etc. for the use of such immovable property. 11. On the other hand, the learned senior advocate for the respondents has relied on the decision of a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court in the case of Vasu Healthcare Private Limited vs. Gujarat Akruti TCG Biotech Limited, AIR 2017 Gujarat 153 wherein a detailed consideration has been made and the conclusion reached therein by taking note of an earlier decision is that on a plain reading of Clause 21c of CC Act, 2015 the expression used must mean actually used or being used. It is further explained that if the intention of the legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the phraseology likely to be used or to be used would have been employed. The verbatim consideration therein is as hereunder Therefore, if the dispute falls within any of the clause 2c the dispute can be said to be commercial dispute for which the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. It is required to be noted that before the learned Commercial Court the original plaintiff relied upon section 2ci, 2cii and 2cxx of the Commercial Courts Act only. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has candidly admitted andor conceded that the case shall not fall within clause 2ci 2cii or 2cxx of the Commercial Courts Act. It is required to be noted that before the learned Commercial Court it was never the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that case would fall within section 2cvii of the learned Commercial Court. Despite the above we have considered on merits whether even considering section 2cvii of the Commercial Courts Act, the dispute between the parties can be said to be commercial dispute within the definition of section 2c of the Commercial Courts Act or not? Considering section 2cvii, commercial dispute means a dispute arising out of the agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce. As observed hereinabove, at the time of filing of the suit and even so pleaded in the plaint, the immovable propertyplots the agreements between the parties cannot be said to be agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce. As per the agreement between the party after getting the plots on lease from the GIDC, the same was required to be thereafter developed by the original defendant No. 1 and after providing all infrastructural facilities and sub-plotting it, the same is required to be given to other persons like the original plaintiff. It is the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that as the original defendant No. 1 has failed to provide any infrastructural facilities and develop the plots and therefore, a civil suit for specific performance of the agreement has been filed. There are other alternative prayers also. Therefore, it cannot be said that the agreement is as such relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce. It is the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that as in clause vii of section 2c, the pharseology used is not actually used or being used and therefore, even if at present the plot is not used and even if it is likely to be used even in future, in that case also, section 2cvii shall be applicable and therefore, the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. The aforesaid has no substance. As per the cardinal principle of law while interpreting a particular statute or the provision, the literal and strict interpretation has to be applied. It may be noted that important words used in the relevant provisions are immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce. If the submission on behalf of the original plaintiff is accepted in that case it would be adding something in the statute which is not there in the statute, which is not permissible. On plain reading of the relevant clause it is clear that the expression used must mean actually used or being used. If the intention of the legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the phraseology used would have been different as for example, likely to be used or to be used. The word used denotes actually used and it cannot be said to be either ready for use or likely to be used or to be used. Similar view has been taken by the Bombay High Court Nagpur Bench in the case of Dineshkumar Gulabchand Agrawal Supra and it is observed and held that the word used denotes actually used and not merely ready for use. It is reported that SLP against the said decision has been dismissed by the Honble Supreme Court. 12. Though we are informed that the said decision is assailed before this Court in a Special Leave Petition we are inclined to agree with the view expressed therein. This is for the reason that this Court while examining the issue relating to exclusive land use, though in the different context has laid emphasis on the present user of the land either for agriculture or non-agriculture purpose being relevant. In that regard, the decision relied on by the learned senior advocate for the respondent in the case of Federation of A.P. Chambers of Commerce  Industry and Ors. vs. State of A.P. and Ors., 2000 6 SCC 550 is noticed, wherein it is observed as under 6. Section 3 of the said Act speaks of land is used for any industrial purpose, land is used for any commercial purpose and land is used for any other non-agricultural purpose. The emphasis is on the word is used. For the purpose of levy of assessment on non-agricultural lands at the rate specified in the Schedule for land used for industrial purposes, therefore, there has to be a finding as a fact that the land is in fact in praesenti in use for an industrial purpose. The same would apply to a commercial purpose or any other non-agricultural purpose. 9. We are in no doubt whatever, therefore, that it is only land which is actually in use for an industrial purpose as defined in the said Act that can be assessed to non-agricultural assessment at the rate specified for land used for industrial purposes. The wider meaning given to the word used in the judgment under challenge is untenable. Having regard to the fact that the said Act is a taxing statute, no Court is justified in imputing to the legislature an intention that it has not clearly expressed in the language it has employed. emphasis supplied 13. The learned senior advocate for the appellant would however, contend that a strict interpretation as in the case of taxing statutes would not be appropriate in the instant case where the issue relates to jurisdiction. In that regard, the learned senior advocate has referred to the statement of objects and reasons with which the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 is enacted so as to provide speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes so as to create the positive image to the investors world about the independent and responsive Indian Legal System. Hence, he contends that a purposive interpretation be made. It is contended that a wider purport and meaning is to be assigned while entertaining the suit and considering the dispute to be a commercial dispute. Having taken note of the submission we feel that the very purpose for which the CC Act of 2015 has been enacted would be defeated if every other suit merely because it is filed before the Commercial Court is entertained. This is for the reason that the suits which are not actually relating to commercial dispute but being filed merely because of the high value and with the intention of seeking early disposal would only clog the system and block the way for the genuine commercial disputes which may have to be entertained by the Commercial Courts as intended by the law makers. In commercial disputes as defined a special procedure is provided for a class of litigation and a strict procedure will have to be followed to entertain only that class of litigation in that jurisdiction. If the same is strictly interpreted it is not as if those excluded will be non-suited without any remedy. The excluded class of litigation will in any event be entertained in the ordinary Civil Courts wherein the remedy has always existed. 14. In that view it is also necessary to carefully examine and entertain only disputes which actually answers the definition commercial disputes as provided under the Act. In the instant case, as already taken note neither the agreement between the parties refers to the nature of the immovable property being exclusively used for trade or commerce as on the date of the agreement nor is there any pleading to that effect in the plaint. Further the very relief sought in the suit is for execution of the Mortgage Deed which is in the nature of specific performance of the terms of Memorandum of Understanding without reference to nature of the use of the immovable property in trade or commerce as on the date of the suit. Therefore, if all these aspects are kept in view, we are of the opinion that in the present facts the High Court was justified in its conclusion arrived through the order dated 01.03.2019 impugned herein. The Commercial Court shall therefore return the plaint indicating a date for its presentation before the Court having jurisdiction. 15. Accordingly, the instant appeal being devoid of merit stands dismissed, with no order as to costs. .J. A.S. BOPANNA New Delhi, October 04, 2019 R. BANUMATHI, J. I have gone through the judgment of my esteemed Brother Justice A.S. Bopanna. I am in full agreement with the conclusion that in order to fall within Section 21cvii of the Commercial Courts Act, the immovable property must be used exclusively or being used exclusively in trade or commerce. However, in view of the importance of the question involved, I would like to give my reasonings for concurring with the conclusion of my esteemed Brother. 2.

Insofar as transferred cases, as per Section 154 of the Act, the Commercial Division or Commercial Court shall prescribe new timelines or issue further directions for speedy and efficacious disposal of such suit or application in accordance with Order XVA of the Code of Civil Procedure. New time period for filing written statement shall be prescribed and the proviso to sub-rule 1 of rule 1 of Order V of the Code of Civil Procedure shall not apply to the transferred cases and the Court may, in its discretion, prescribe a new time period within which the written statement shall be filed. 15. The preamble of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 reads as under- An Act to provide for the constitution of Commercial Courts, Commercial Appellate Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division in the High Courts for adjudicating commercial disputes of specified value and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 16. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Commercial Courts Act reads as under- Statement of Objects and Reasons The proposal to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes has been under consideration of the Government for quite some time. The high value commercial disputes involve complex facts and question of law. Therefore, there is a need to provide for an independent mechanism for their early resolution. Early resolution of commercial disputes shall create a positive image to the investor world about the independent and responsive Indian legal system. . 6. It is proposed to introduce the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Bill, 2015 to replace the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Ordinance, 2015 which inter alia, provides for the following namely- i constitution of the Commercial Courts at District level except for the territory over which any High Court is having ordinary original civil jurisdiction ii constitution of the Commercial Divisions in those High Courts which are already exercising ordinary civil jurisdiction and they shall have territorial jurisdiction over such areas on which it has original jurisdiction iii constitution of the Commercial Appellate Division in all the High Courts to hear the appeals against the Orders of the Commercial Courts and the Orders of the Commercial Division of the High Court iv the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of such Commercial Courts and Commercial Division is proposed as one crore rupees and v to amend the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as applicable to the Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions which shall prevail over the existing High Courts Rules and other provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases. ... The object and purpose of Commercial Courts Act is to ensure that the Commercial Courts, Commercial Appellate Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of the High Courts and also to ensure that the commercial cases are disposed of expeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant. 17. Section 13 deals with appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions. As per Section 14 of the Act, the Commercial Appellate Court and the Commercial Appellate Division shall endeavour to dispose of appeals filed before it within a period of six months from the date of filing of such appeal. Fast Track Procedure for deciding the Commercial Disputes 18. As per Section 16 of the Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended under the Act, shall apply in the trial of suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a specified value. Section 16 of the Act reads as under- 16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes.  1 The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 5 of 1908 shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule. 2 The Commercial Division and Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 5 of 1908, as amended by this Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value. 3 Where any provision of any rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 5 of 1908, by the State Government is in conflict with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 5 of 1908, as amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail. 19. The Schedule to the Commercial Courts Act amends various provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and thereby makes significant departure from the Code. After Order XIII of the Code, Order XIIIA - Summary Judgment has been inserted. Order XIIIA contains the scope and classes of suits to which Order XIIIA applies, grounds for summary judgment, procedure to be followed, evidence for hearing of summary judgment, orders that may be made by Court in such proceedings for summary judgment, etc. After Order XV of the Code, Order XVACase Management Hearing has been inserted. Order XVA provides for first Case Management Hearing Rule 1 recording of oral evidence on a day-to-day basis Rule 4 powers of the Court in a Case Management Hearing Rule 6 adjournment of Case Management Hearing Rule 7 consequences of non-compliance with orders Rule 8. By way of amendment, several rules have been incorporated to make the matters of commercial disputes on fast track. In Order XX of the Code  Judgment, Rule 1 has been substituted that within ninety days of the conclusion of arguments, the Commercial CourtCommercial DivisionCommercial Appellate Division to pronounce the judgment and copies thereof shall be issued to all the parties to the dispute through electronic mail or otherwise. 20. Various provisions of the Act namely Case Management Hearing and other provisions makes the court to adopt a pro-active approach in resolving the commercial dispute. A new approach for carrying out case management and strict guidelines for completion of the process has been introduced so that the adjudicatory process is not delayed. I have referred to the various provisions of the Act and the Schedule bringing in amendments brought to the Civil Procedure Code to deal with the commercial disputes, only to highlight that the trial of the commercial dispute suits is put on fast track for disposal of the suits expeditiously. Various provisions of the Act referred to above and the amendments inserted to Civil Procedure Code by the Schedule is to ensure speedy resolution of the commercial disputes in a time bound manner. The intent of the legislature seems to be to have a procedure which expedites the disposal of commercial disputes and thus creates a positive environment for investment and development and make India an attractive place to do business. 21. A perusal of the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and the various amendments to Civil Procedure Code and insertion of new rules to the Code applicable to suits of commercial disputes show that it has been enacted for the purpose of providing an early disposal of high value commercial disputes. A purposive interpretation of the Objects and Reasons and various amendments to Civil Procedure Code leaves no room for doubt that the provisions of the Act require to be strictly construed. If the provisions are given a liberal interpretation, the object behind constitution of Commercial Division of Courts, viz. putting the matter on fast track and speedy resolution of commercial disputes, will be defeated. If we take a closer look at the Statement of Objects and Reasons, words such as early and speedy have been incorporated and reiterated. The object shall be fulfilled only if the provisions of the Act are interpreted in a narrow sense and not hampered by the usual procedural delays plaguing our traditional legal system. 22. A dispute relating to immovable property per se may not be a commercial dispute. But it becomes a commercial dispute, if it falls under sub-clause vii of Section 21c of the Act viz. the agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce. The words used exclusively in trade or commerce are to be interpreted purposefully. The word used denotes actually used and it cannot be either ready for use or likely to be used or to be used. It should be actually used. Such a wide interpretation would defeat the objects of the Act and the fast tracking procedure discussed above. 23. On 03.11.2017, a Memorandum of Understanding was executed between the appellant-plaintiff, respondent-defendant and Ketan Bhailalbhai Shah-second respondent. As per the terms of MOU, parties executed a Deed of Conveyance of the land. A mortgage deed was executed simultaneously along with the MOU with respect to the part of the land admeasuring 15,000 sq.ft. in favour of the plaintiff. It was understood between the parties that respondent No.1 would apply for change of land use permission for the land in question on signing of the MOU. Mortgage deed was executed by respondent No.1 in favour of the appellant in order to ensure performance of obligations under the MOU. But the said mortgage deed was not presented for registration. 24. It appears that the trial court has proceeded under the footing that the parties to the suit more particularly, the appellant-plaintiff seems to be carrying on business as Estate Agent and to manage land, building, etc. and the very object as enumerated in Memorandum and Articles of Association of the appellant-plaintiff company established that the property in question are being used exclusively in trade or commerce rather in the business of the plaintiff. As rightly pointed out by the High Court, there is nothing on record to show that at the time when agreement to sell came to be executed in 2012, the property was being exclusively used in trade and commerce so as to bring dispute within the ambit of sub-clause vii of Section 21c of the Act. Merely because, the property is likely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same cannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court. 25. In the case of Ujwala Raje Gaekwar v. Hemaben Achyut Shah 2017 SCC Guj 583, a Special Civil Suit No.5332011 was instituted for declaration that the sale deed valued at Rs.17.76 crores executed by the appellant-original defendant No.1 in favour of respondent No.4 be declared illegal and also, for permanent injunction with respect to the land in question. The appellants-defendants thereon filed an application that in sale deed, it has been clearly mentioned that the agreement relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce and falls within the meaning of Section 21cvii of the Commercial Courts Act and that the matters above, the value of rupees one crore are to be transferred to the Commercial Court. Trial court rejected the said application which was challenged before the Gujarat High Court. The Gujarat High Court held that the aim, object and purpose of establishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that the cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of expeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant, and if such a suit which is as such arising out of the probate proceedings andor is dispute with respect to the property are transferred to the Commercial DivisionCommercial Court, there shall not be any difference between the Regular Civil Courts and the Commercial DivisionCommercial Courts and the object for the establishment of the Commercial DivisionCommercial Courts shall be frustrated. 26. In Vasu Healthcare Private Limited v. Gujarat Akruti TCG Biotch Limited  Another 2017 SCC OnLine Guj 724, referred to in extenso by my learned Brother, it was held that on plain reading of the relevant clause, it is clear that the expression used must mean actually used or being used. If the intention of the legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the phraseology used would have been different as for example, likely to be used or to be used. The word used denotes actually used and it cannot be said to be either ready for use or likely to be used or to be used. We entirely agree with the above purposive interpretation adopted by the Gujarat High Court. 27. The object and purpose of the establishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that the cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of expeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigants. Keeping in view the object and purpose of the establishment of the Commercial Courts and fast tracking procedure provided under the Act, the statutory provisions of the Act and the words incorporated thereon are to be meaningfully interpreted for quick disposal of commercial litigations so as to benefit the litigants especially those who are engaged in trade and commerce which in turn will further economic growth of the country. On the above reasonings, I agree with the conclusion arrived at by my esteemed brother Justice A.S. Bopanna. .J. R. BANUMATHI New Delhi October 04, 2019.",

Nariman Bench Hrishikesh Roy, B.R. Gavai, R. F. Nariman REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 995 OF 2021  SLP CIVIL No.665 of 2021 GOVERNMENT OF MAHARASHTRA WATER RESOURCES DEPARTMENT REPRESENTED BY EXECUTIVE ENGINEER APPELLANT VERSUS MS BORSE BROTHERS ENGINEERS  CONTRACTORS PVT. LTD. RESPONDENT WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO. 999 OF 2021  SLP CIVIL No.15278 of 2020 AND CIVIL APPEAL NO. 996-998 OF 2021  SLP CIVIL No. 4872-4874 of 2021 Diary No.18079 of 2020 JUDGMENT R.F. Nariman, J. 1. Leave granted. Delay condoned in SLP C Diary No.18079 of 2020. 2. The substantial question of law which arises in these appeals is as to whether the judgment of a Division Bench of this Court in N.V. International v. State of Assam, 2020 2 SCC 109 N.V. International lays down the law correctly. This Court followed its earlier judgment in Union of India v. Varindera Constructions Ltd., 2020 2 SCC 111 Varindera Constructions and held as follows 3. Having heard the learned counsel for both sides, we may observe that the matter is no longer res integra. In Union of India v. Varindera Constructions Ltd. Union of India v. Varindera Constructions Ltd., 2020 2 SCC 111 , this Court, by its judgment and order dated 17-9-2018 Union of India v. Varindera Constructions Ltd., 2020 2 SCC 111 held thus SCC p. 112, paras 1-5 1. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties. 2. By a judgment dated 19-4-2018 in Union of India v. Varindera Constructions Ltd. Union of India v. Varindera Constructions Ltd., 2018 7 SCC 794, this Court has in near identical facts and circumstances allowed the appeal of the Union of India in a proceeding arising from an arbitral award. 3. Ordinarily, we would have applied the said judgment to this case as well. However, we find that the impugned Division Bench judgment dated 10-4-2013 Union of India v. Varindera Constructions Ltd., 2013 SCC OnLine Del 6511 has dismissed the appeal filed by the Union of India on the ground of delay. The delay was found to be 142 days in filing the appeal and 103 days in refiling the appeal. One of the important points made by the Division Bench is that, apart from the fact that there is no sufficient cause made out in the grounds of delay, since a Section 34 application has to be filed within a maximum period of 120 days including the grace period of 30 days, an appeal filed from the selfsame proceeding under Section 37 should be covered by the same drill. 4. Given the fact that an appellate proceeding is a continuation of the original proceeding, as has been held in Lachmeshwar Prasad Shukul v. Keshwar Lal Chaudhuri Lachmeshwar Prasad Shukul v. Keshwar Lal Chaudhuri, 1940 SCC OnLine FC 10  AIR 1941 FC 5 , and repeatedly followed by our judgments, we feel that any delay beyond 120 days in the filing of an appeal under Section 37 from an application being either dismissed or allowed under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 should not be allowed as it will defeat the overall statutory purpose of arbitration proceedings being decided with utmost despatch. 5. In this view of the matter, since even the original appeal was filed with a delay period of 142 days, we are not inclined to entertain these special leave petitions on the facts of this particular case. The special leave petitions stand disposed of accordingly. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of. 4. We may only add that what we have done in the aforesaid judgment is to add to the period of 90 days, which is provided by statute for filing of appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, a grace period of 30 days under Section 5 of the Limitation Act by following Lachmeshwar Prasad Shukul Lachmeshwar Prasad Shukul v. Keshwar Lal Chaudhuri, 1940 SCC OnLine FC 10  AIR 1941 FC 5 , as also having regard to the object of speedy resolution of all arbitral disputes which was uppermost in the minds of the framers of the 1996 Act, and which has been strengthened from time to time by amendments made thereto. The present delay being beyond 120 days is not liable, therefore, to be condoned. 3. In two of the three appeals before us, i.e., Civil Appeal arising out of SLP C No. 665 of 2021 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP C Diary No.18079 of 2020, the High Courts of Bombay and Delhi vide judgments dated 17.12.2020 and 15.10.2019 respectively, dismissed the appeals filed by the Government of Maharashtra and by the Union of India respectively, refusing to condone the delay in the filing of the appeal under section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 Arbitration Act beyond 120 days. So far as the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP C No.15278 of 2020 is concerned, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh refused to follow the judgment of this Court in N.V. International supra stating that there is a conflict between this judgment and the judgment of a larger Bench of this Court reported in Consolidated Engg. Enterprises v. Irrigation Deptt., 2008 7 SCC 169 Consolidated Engg.. It was, therefore, held that it was open for the High Court to condone the delay applying section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 Limitation Act and, as a matter of fact, a delay of what was stated to be 57 days was condoned. 4. Shri Sandeep Sudhakar Deshmukh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Government of Maharashtra Water Resources Department Govt of Maharashtra, the appellant in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP C No. 665 of 2021, submitted that the Arbitration Act in its original avatar did not include the concept or idea of expeditious resolution of disputes. At best, the Arbitration Act can be treated as a mechanism providing for alternate dispute resolution. This original objective is continued by the Arbitration and Conciliation Amendment Act, 2015 2015 Amendment which provides a time limit for arbitral awards and for fast track procedure contained in sections 29A and 29B of the Arbitration Act. This being the case, the very foundation of N.V. International supra is erroneous in law. Shri Deshmukh also argued that section 37 of the Arbitration Act provides for appeals from several orders, including orders made under sections 8, 9, 16 and 17, apart from orders that may be made under section 34 of the Arbitration Act. According to him, the rationale or logic contained in N.V. International supra would perhaps apply only to appeals from section 34 orders, but not to orders that are passed under any of the other aforesaid sections, as there is no hard and fast application of a 120-day limitation period when it comes to applications that have been filed under any of these sections. 5. Shri Deshmukh also argued that section 33 of the Arbitration Act contemplates correction and interpretation of an award, the arbitral tribunal being clothed with the power to extend time without there being any outer limit. He also stated that vide section 292 of the Limitation Act, the period of limitation for filing applications under the Arbitration Act would be governed by Article 137 of the Limitation Act, providing for a much longer limitation period of three years. He further argued that Articles 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act provide different periods of limitation, being 90 days and 30 days respectively. Since these different prescribed periods lead to arbitrary results, the concept of an appeal would have to be read into the definition of the term application so that the appeal provision under section 37 of the Arbitration Act is uniformly governed by Article 137 of the Limitation Act, which would lead to a uniform limitation period of three years. He also argued that to read the period of limitation contemplated under section 343 for an appeal filed under section 37 of the Arbitration Act, would amount to judicial legislation due to the absence of any period of limitation provided in section 37. He placed reliance on a large number of judgments citing cases where the Limitation Act had been held to be applicable to arbitration proceedings and others in which it had not so been held. He also cited a large number of judgments on section 292 of the Limitation Act, relating to the meaning of express exclusion under the said section. He then cited judgments on the applicability of Article 137 of the Limitation Act and a judgment which eschews judicial legislation. 6. Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Union of India, the appellant in the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP C Diary No. 18079 of 2020, read in detail the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 Commercial Courts Act and referred to the two Law Commission Reports which led to its enactment, namely the 188th Law Commission Report and the 253rd Law Commission Report. She then referred to this Courts judgments in Kandla Export Corpn. v. OCI Corpn., 2018 14 SCC 715 Kandla Export Corpn and BGS SGS SOMA JV v. NHPC, 2020 4 SCC 234, dealing with the interplay between section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act and section 37 of the Arbitration Act. She argued that a limitation period of 60 days was laid down by section 131A of the Commercial Courts Act, and though section 14 thereof commands that an expeditious disposal of appeals take place within a period of six months from the date of filing such appeal, neither of the two provisions bound appellate courts not to apply section 5 of the Limitation Act to relax the period of limitation in deserving cases. She also relied upon section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, which speaks of the Limitation Act in the context of the Commercial Courts Act. She then referred to section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act read with the Schedule, and, in particular, the amendment made to Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 CPC which closes the right of defence after a certain period of limitation is over, which is to be contrasted with section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, which contains no such provision. She then referred to judgments under different statutes such as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 IBC and the Electricity Act, 2003 in which section 5 of the Limitation Act becomes inapplicable by virtue of either the scheme of the statute in question or by virtue of an express exclusion spoken of in section 292 of the Limitation Act. 7. Shri Amalpushp Shroti, learned counsel appearing for the respondents in the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP C No. 15278 of 2020, broadly supported the arguments of Shri Deshmukh and Ms. Bhati, while citing certain other judgments to buttress the same submissions. 8. Shri Vinay Navare, learned Senior Advocate appearing for Ms Borse Brothers Engineers and Contractors Pvt. Ltd Borse Bros., the respondent in the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP C No. 665 of 2021, was at pains to point out the conduct of the Govt of Maharashtra and added that if a period of 60 days is to be reckoned under the Commercial Courts Act, the appeal filed by the Govt of Maharashtra would be delayed by a period of 131 days for which there is no explanation worthy of the name. He relied heavily on the impugned judgment of the High Court of Bombay which had also stated that though the certified copy of the judgment was applied for and was ready by 27.05.2019, the Govt of Maharashtra wrongly mentioned that it received such copy only on 24.07.2019, as a result of which the Govt of Maharashtra had not appeared before the High Court with clean hands. 9. Further, Shri Navare sought to answer Shri Deshmukhs submission that the rationale of N.V. International supra can and should apply to an appeal filed against a section 34 order, as several different appeal provisions were all bunched together in one section and could have been the subject matter of different appellate provisions contained in the very original proceeding that was sought to be appealed against. He, therefore, argued that the scheme contained in the Arbitration Act, insofar as appeals from section 8 applications are concerned, is that it is only if a section 8 application is refused that an appeal lies and not otherwise, contrasting it with an appeal against a section 34 order, which lies whether or not the court allows the section 34 application. Hence, according to the learned Senior Advocate, each appellate provision would have its own rationale, appeals in the cases of section 8, 9, 16 and 17 of the Arbitration Act allowing for sufficient cause to be shown beyond the period of 30 days, as opposed to appeals filed under section 34, which ought to allow for sufficient cause being shown upto a period of 30 days, or else the whole object of section 34 would be destroyed. He referred to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Arbitration Act and judgments to show that Shri Deshmukhs submission that the Arbitration Act provided only alternate dispute resolution and not speedy disposal was wholly incorrect. He also pointed out that specific timelines are contained in several sections of the Arbitration Act such as sections 92, 114, 1113, 132-5, 29A, 29B, 333-5 and 343, to indicate that the object of speedy disposal was at the heart of the Arbitration Act. 10. Shri Navare then relied upon the Commercial Courts Act and in particular, on sections 131A and 14, to show that the whole object of speedy disposal of appeals contained in the Commercial Courts Act would be given a go-bye if long periods of delay beyond 30 days are to be condoned, since the appeal itself has to be decided within a period of six months. He also cited a number of judgments and supported the judgment of this Court in N.V. International supra by arguing that a judge is not helpless when faced with a provision which, when literally read, would result in arbitrary and unjust orders being passed. He also referred to judgments where a casus omissus could be supplied, which is what was done in N.V. International supra. 11. Shri Manoj Chouhan, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Ms Swastik Wires, the appellant in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP C No.15278 of 2020, supported the impugned judgment dated 27.01.2020 of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh and argued that this Courts judgment in Consolidated Engg. supra, being a judgment of three learned judges, would prevail over the judgment of this Court in N.V. International supra, which is only delivered by two learned judges and, therefore, delay can be condoned. He also added that once section 5 of the Limitation Act applies, the Court cannot impose any limits on the expression sufficient cause and even if there are long delays and sufficient cause is made out, such delays can be condoned. Further, he argued that this Court could use Article 142 of the Constitution, which is a veritable brahmāstra and panacea for all ills, to do justice in individual cases. 12. Dr. Amit George, learned counsel appearing for Ms Associated Construction Co., the respondent in the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP C Diary No. 18079 of 2020, argued that section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, having regard to the object of speedy disposal sought to be achieved, excludes the application of section 5 of the Limitation Act altogether. For this purpose, he relied heavily upon the judgment of this Court in Kandla Export Corpn supra and the judgment of this Court in CCE  Customs v. Hongo India P Ltd., 2009 5 SCC 791 Hongo which dealt with section 35-H1 of the Central Excise Act, 1944 Central Excise Act. He also relied upon other judgments which interpreted section 292 of the Limitation Act to state that the scheme of a particular statute may make it clear that there is an express exclusion of section 5 of the Limitation Act, which is the case under the Commercial Courts Act. He then relied strongly upon the judgment in N.V. International supra by supporting its logic and citing judgments which would show that other sections of the Limitation Act were excluded in the context of section 343 of the Arbitration Act  such as sections 4 and 17 of the Limitation Act. In any case, he argued that on facts sufficient cause had not been made out, and that the judgment of the High Court of Delhi dated 15.10.2019 ought to be set aside on this ground also. 13. The arguments that have been made in these appeals and the case law cited have gone way beyond the narrow question which arises before us. However, in dealing with these arguments, it is necessary to first set out the relevant statutory provisions contained in the three statutes that have been strongly relied upon by either side in these appeals. 14. First and foremost, the Arbitration Act has, in its Statement of Objects and Reasons, the following 4. The main objectives of the Bill are as under- xxx xxx xxx ii to make provision for an arbitral procedure which is fair, efficient and capable of meeting the needs of the specific arbitration xxx xxx xxx v to minimise the supervisory role of courts in the arbitral process 15. As has correctly been pointed out by Shri Navare, the requirement of an arbitral procedure which is efficient and the minimising of the supervisory role of courts in arbitral process would certainly show that one of the main objectives of the Arbitration Act is the speedy disposal of disputes through the arbitral process. Section 5 of the Arbitration Act is important and states  5. Extent of judicial intervention.Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by this Part, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this Part. 16. The other relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act provide as follows 8. Power to refer parties to arbitration where there is an arbitration agreement. 1 A judicial authority, before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party to the arbitration agreement or any person claiming through or under him, so applies not later than the date of submitting his first statement on the substance of the dispute, then, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any Court, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exists. 2 The application referred to in sub-section 1 shall not be entertained unless it is accompanied by the original arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy thereof 2 Provided that where the original arbitration agreement or a certified copy thereof is not available with the party applying for reference to arbitration under sub-section 1, and the said agreement or certified copy is retained by the other party to that agreement, then, the party so applying shall file such application along with a copy of the arbitration agreement and a petition praying the Court to call upon the other party to produce the original arbitration agreement or its duly certified copy before that Court. 3 Notwithstanding that an application has been made under sub-section 1 and that the issue is pending before the judicial authority, an arbitration may be commenced or continued and an arbitral award made. 9. Interim measures, etc., by Court. xxx xxx xxx 2 Where, before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, a Court passes an order for any interim measure of protection under sub-section 1, the arbitral proceedings shall be commenced within a period of ninety days from the date of such order or within such further time as the Court may determine. 11. Appointment of arbitrators. xxx xxx xxx 4 If the appointment procedure in sub-section 3 applies and a a party fails to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days from the receipt of a request to do so from the other party or b the two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within thirty days from the date of their appointment, the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court or any person or institution designated by such Court xxx xxx xxx 13 An application made under this section for appointment of an arbitrator or arbitrators shall be disposed of by the Supreme Court or the High Court or the person or institution designated by such Court, as the case maybe, as expeditiously as possible and an endeavour shall be made to dispose of the matter within a period of sixty days from the date of service of notice on the opposite party 13. Challenge procedure. 1 Subject to sub-section 4, the parties are free to agree on a procedure for challenging an arbitrator. 2 Failing any agreement referred to in sub-section 1, a party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall, within fifteen days after becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal or after becoming aware of any circumstances referred to in sub-section3 of section 12, send a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral tribunal. 3 Unless the arbitrator challenged under sub-section 2 withdraws from his office or the other party agrees to the challenge, the arbitral tribunal shall decide on the challenge. 4 If a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or under the procedure under subsection 2 is not successful, the arbitral tribunal shall continue the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award. 5 Where an arbitral award is made under sub-section 4, the party challenging the arbitrator may make an application for setting aside such an arbitral award in accordance with section 34. 6 Where an arbitral award is set aside on an application made under sub-section 5, the Court may decide as to whether the arbitrator who is challenged is entitled to any fees. 16. Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction. xxx xxx xxx 2 A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence however, a party shall not be precluded from raising such a plea merely because that he has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator. 29A. Time limit for arbitral award. 1The award in matters other than international commercial arbitration shall be made by the arbitral tribunal within a period of twelve months from the date of completion of pleadings under sub-section 4 of section 23 Provided that the award in the matter of international commercial arbitration may be made as expeditiously as possible and endeavor may be made to dispose of the matter within a period of twelve months from the date of completion of pleadings under sub-section 4 of section 23. 2 If the award is made within a period of six months from the date the arbitral tribunal enters upon the reference, the arbitral tribunal shall be entitled to receive such amount of additional fees as the parties may agree. 3 The parties may, by consent, extend the period specified in sub-section 1 for making award for a further period not exceeding six months. 4 If the award is not made within the period specified in sub-section 1 or the extended period specified under sub- section 3, the mandate of the arbitrators shall terminate unless the Court has, either prior to or after the expiry of the period so specified, extended the period Provided that while extending the period under this sub- section, if the Court finds that the proceedings have been delayed for the reasons attributable to the arbitral tribunal, then, it may order reduction of fees of arbitrators by not exceeding five per cent. for each month of such delay. Provided further that where an application under sub- section 5 is pending, the mandate of the arbitrator shall continue till the disposal of the said application Provided also that the arbitrator shall be given an opportunity of being heard before the fees is reduced. 5 The extension of period referred to in sub-section 4 may be on the application of any of the parties and may be granted only for sufficient cause and on such terms and conditions as may be imposed by the Court. 6 While extending the period referred to in sub-section 4, it shall be open to the Court to substitute one or all of the arbitrators and if one or all of the arbitrators are substituted, the arbitral proceedings shall continue from the stage already reached and on the basis of the evidence and material already on record, and the arbitratorsappointed under this section shall be deemed to have received the said evidence and material. 7 In the event of arbitrators being appointed under this section, the arbitral tribunal thus reconstituted shall be deemed to be in continuation of the previously appointed arbitral tribunal. 8 It shall be open to the Court to impose actual or exemplary costs upon any of the parties under this section. 9 An application filed under sub-section 5 shall be disposed of by the Court as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made to dispose of the matter within a period of sixty days from the date of service of notice on the opposite party 29B. Fast track procedure. 1 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the parties to an arbitration agreement, may, at any stage either before or at the time of appointment of the arbitral tribunal, agree in writing to have their dispute resolved by fast track procedure specified in sub-section 3. 2 The parties to the arbitration agreement, while agreeing for resolution of dispute by fast track procedure, may agree that the arbitral tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator who shall be chosen by the parties. 3 The arbitral tribunal shall follow the following procedure while conducting arbitration proceedings under sub-section 1 a The arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute on the basis of written pleadings, documents and submissions filed by the parties without any oral hearing b The arbitral tribunal shall have power to call for any further information or clarification from the parties in addition to the pleadings and documents filed by them c An oral hearing may be held only, if, all the parties make a request or if the arbitral tribunal considers it necessary to have oral hearing for clarifying certain issues d The arbitral tribunal may dispense with any technical formalities, if an oral hearing is held, and adopt such procedure as deemed appropriate for expeditious disposal of the case. 4 The award under this section shall be made within a period of six months from the date the arbitral tribunal enters upon the reference. 5 If the award is not made within the period specified in sub-section 4, the provisions of subsections 3 to 9 of section 29A shall apply to the proceedings. 6 The fees payable to the arbitrator and the manner of payment of the fees shall be such as may be agreed between the arbitrator and the parties. 33. Correction and interpretation of award additional award. xxx xxx xxx 3 The arbitral tribunal may correct any error of the type referred to in clause a of sub-section 1, on its own initiative, within thirty days from the date of the arbitral award. 4 Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party with notice to the other party, may request, within thirty days from the receipt of the arbitral award, the arbitral tribunal to make an additional arbitral award as to claims presented in the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the arbitral award. 5 If the arbitral tribunal considers the request made under sub-section 4 to be justified, it shall make the additional arbitral award within sixty days from the receipt of such request. 34. Application for setting aside arbitral award. xxx xxx xxx 3 An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter. 37. Appealable orders. 1 Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, an appeal shall lie from the following orders and from no others to the Court authorised by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the Court passing the order, namely a refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section 8 b granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9 c setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34. 2 Appeal shall also lie to a court from an order of the arbitral tribunal a accepting the plea referred to in sub-section 2 or sub-section 3 of section 16 or b granting or refusing to grant an interim measure under section 17. 3 No second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this section, but nothing in this section shall affect or takeaway any right to appeal to the Supreme Court. 43. Limitations. 1 The Limitation Act, 1963 36 of 1963, shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in court. 2 For the purposes of this section and the Limitation Act, 1963 36 of 1963,an arbitration shall be deemed to have commenced on the date referred to in section 21. 3 Where an arbitration agreement to submit future disputes to arbitration provides that any claim to which the agreement applies shall be barred unless some step to commence arbitral proceedings is taken within a time fixed by the agreement, and a dispute arises to which the agreement applies, the Court, if it is of opinion that in the circumstances of the case undue hardship would otherwise be caused, and notwithstanding that the time so fixed has expired, may on such terms, if any, as the justice of the case may require, extend the time for such period as it thinks proper. 4 Where the Court orders that an arbitral award be set aside, the period between the commencement of the arbitration and the date of the order of the Court shall be excluded in computing the time prescribed by the Limitation Act, 1963 36 of 1963,for the commencement of the proceedings including arbitration with respect to the dispute so submitted. 17. So far as the Limitation Act is concerned, sections 5 and 292 read as follows 5. Extension of prescribed period in certain cases. Any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 5 of 1908, may be admitted after the prescribed period if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period. Explanation.The fact that the appellant or the applicant was missed by any order, practice or judgment of the High Court in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period may be sufficient cause within the meaning of this section. 29. Savings. xxx xxx xxx 2 Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by the Schedule, the provisions of section 3 shall apply as if such period were the period prescribed by the Schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law, the provisions contained in sections 4 to 24 inclusive shall apply only in so far as, and to the extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law. 18. Further, the relevant Articles of the Schedule provide as follows THE SCHEDULE PERIODS OF LIMITATION xxx xxx xxx Description of suit Period of Time from which limitation period begins to run 116. Under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 5 of 1908 a to a High Court Ninety days. The date of the from any decree or decree or order. order. b to any other Thirty days. The date of the court from any decree or order. decree or order. 117. From a decree Thirty days. The date of the or order of any High decree or order. Court to the same Court 137. Any other Three years. When the right to application for which apply accrues. no period of limitation is provided elsewhere in this Division. 19. The Commercial Courts Act states, in its Statement of Objects and Reasons, the following STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS The proposal to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes has been under consideration of the Government for quite some time. The high vlaue commercial disputes involve complex facts and question of law. Therefore, there is a need to provide for an independent mechanism for their early resolution. Early resolution of commercial disputes shall create a positive image to the investor world about the independent and responsive Indian legal system. 6. It is proposed to introduced the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Bill, 2015 to replace the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Ordinance, 2015 which inter alia, provides for the following namely xxx xxx xxx v to amend the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as applicable to the Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions which shall prevail over the existing High Courts Rules and other provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 so as to improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases. 7. The proposed Bill shall accelerate economic growth, improve the international image of the Indian Justice delivery system, and the faith of the investor world in the legal culture of the nation. 20. Section 21i of the Commercial Courts Act defines specified value as follows 2. Definitions.1 In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, xxx xxx xxx i Specified Value, in relation to a commercial dispute, shall mean the value of the subject-matter in respect of a suit as determined in accordance with section 12 which shall not be less than three lakh rupees or such higher value, as may be notified by the Central Government. 21. Chapter II of the Commercial Courts Act sets up commercial courts, commercial appellate courts, commercial divisions and commercial appellate divisions. So far as arbitration is concerned, section 10 is important and states as follows 10. Jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters. Where the subject-matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a Specified Value and 1 If such arbitration is an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 26 of 1996 that have been filed in a High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such Commercial Division has been constituted in such High Court. 2 If such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 26 of 1996 that have been filed on the original side of the High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such Commercial Division has been constituted in such High Court. 3 If such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 26 of 1996 that would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district not being a High Court shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such Commercial Court has been constituted. 22. The other relevant provisions of the Commercial Courts Act are set out as follows 13. Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions. 1 Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court below the level of a District Judge may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Court within a period of sixty days from the date of judgment or order. 1A Any person aggrieved by the judgment or order of a Commercial Court at the level of District Judge exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may be, Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment or order Provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 5 of 1908 as amended by this Act and section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 26 of 1996. 2 Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act. 14. Expeditious disposal of appeals.The Commercial Appellate Court and the Commercial Appellate Division shall endeavour to dispose of appeals filed before it within a period of six months from the date of filing of such appeal. 16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to commercial disputes. 1 The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 5 of 1908 shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule. 2 The Commercial Division and Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 5 of 1908, as amended by this Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value. 3 Where any provision of any Rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 5 of 1908, by the State Government is in conflict with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 5 of 1908, as amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail. 21. Act to have overriding effect.Save as otherwise provided, the provisions of this Act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law for the time being in force other than this Act. SCHEDULE 4. Amendment of First Schedule.In the First Schedule to the Code, xxx xxx xxx D in Order VIII, i in Rule 1, for the proviso, the following proviso shall be substituted, namely Provided that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. 23. Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, when read with section 43 thereof, makes it clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act will apply to appeals that are filed under section 37. This takes us to Articles 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act, which provide for a limitation period of 90 days and 30 days, depending upon whether the appeal is from any other court to a High Court or an intra-High Court appeal. There can be no doubt whatsoever that section 5 of the Limitation Act will apply to the aforesaid appeals, both by virtue of section 43 of the Arbitration Act and by virtue of section 292 of the Limitation Act. This aspect of the matter has been set out in the concurring judgment of Raveendran, J. in Consolidated Engg. supra, as follows 40. Let me next refer to the relevant provisions of the Limitation Act. Section 3 of the Limitation Act provides for the bar of limitation. It provides that subject to the provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24 inclusive, every suit instituted, appeal preferred, and application made after the prescribed period shall be dismissed although limitation has not been set up as a defence. Prescribed period means that period of limitation computed in accordance with the provisions of the Limitation Act. Period of limitation means the period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by the Schedule to the Limitation Act vide Section 2j of the said Act. Section 29 of the Limitation Act relates to savings. Sub-section 2 thereof which is relevant is extracted below 29. 2 Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by the Schedule, the provisions of Section 3 shall apply as if such period were the period prescribed by the Schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law, the provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24 inclusive shall apply only insofar as, and to the extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law. 41. Article 116 of the Schedule prescribes the period of limitation for appeals to the High Court 90 days and appeals to any other court 30 days under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. It is now well settled that the words appeals under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 occurring in Article 116 refer not only to appeals preferred under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, but also to appeals, where the procedure for filing of such appeals and powers of the court for dealing with such appeals are governed by the Code of Civil Procedure. See decision of the Constitution Bench in Vidyacharan Shukla v. Khubchand Baghel AIR 1964 SC 1099 . Article 119b of the Schedule prescribes the period of limitation for filing an application under the Arbitration Act, 1940, for setting aside an award, as thirty days from the date of service of notice of filing of the award. 42. The AC Act is no doubt, a special law, consolidating and amending the law relating to arbitration and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The AC Act does not prescribe the period of limitation, for various proceedings under that Act, except where it intends to prescribe a period different from what is prescribed in the Limitation Act. On the other hand, Section 43 makes the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 applicable to proceedingsboth in court and in arbitrationunder the AC Act. There is also no express exclusion of application of any provision of the Limitation Act to proceedings under the AC Act, but there are some specific departures from the general provisions of the Limitation Act, as for example, the proviso to Section 343 and sub-sections 2 to 4 of Section 43 of the AC Act. 43. Where the Schedule to the Limitation Act prescribes a period of limitation for appeals or applications to any court, and the special or local law provides for filing of appeals and applications to the court, but does not prescribe any period of limitation in regard to such appeals or applications, the period of limitation prescribed in the Schedule to the Limitation Act will apply to such appeals or applications and consequently, the provisions of Sections 4 to 24 will also apply. Where the special or local law prescribes for any appeal or application, a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by the Schedule to the Limitation Act, then the provisions of Section 292 will be attracted. In that event, the provisions of Section 3 of the Limitation Act will apply, as if the period of limitation prescribed under the special law was the period prescribed by the Schedule to the Limitation Act, and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for the appeal or application by the special law, the provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24 will apply to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special law. The object of Section 292 is to ensure that the principles contained in Sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act apply to suits, appeals and applications filed in a court under special or local laws also, even if it prescribes a period of limitation different from what is prescribed in the Limitation Act, except to the extent of express exclusion of the application of any or all of those provisions. 24. When the Commercial Courts Act is applied to the aforesaid appeals, given the definition of specified value and the provisions contained in sections 10 and 13 thereof, it is clear that it is only when the specified value is for a sum less than three lakh rupees that the appellate provision contained in section 37 of the Arbitration Act will be governed, for the purposes of limitation, by Articles 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act. Shri Deshmukhs argument that depending upon which court decides a matter, a limitation period of either 30 or 90 days is provided, which leads to arbitrary results, and that, therefore, the uniform period provided by Article 137 of the Limitation Act should govern appeals as well, is rejected. It is settled that periods of limitation must always to some extent be arbitrary and may result in some hardship, but this is no reason as to why they should not be strictly followed. In Boota Mal v. Union of India, 1963 1 SCR 70, this Court referred to this aspect of the case, as follows Ordinarily, the words of a statute have to be given their strict grammatical meaning and equitable considerations are out of place, particularly in provisions of law limiting the period of limitation for filing suits or legal proceedings. This was laid down by the Privy Council in two decisions in Nagendranath v. Suresh AIR1932 PC 165 and General Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corporation Limited v. Janmahomed Abdul Rahim AIR 1941 PC 6 . In the first case the Privy Council observed that the fixation of periods of limitation must always be to some extent arbitrary and may frequently result in hardship. But in construing such provisions equitable considerations are out of place, and the strict grammatical meaning of the words is the only safe guide. In the latter case it was observed that a limitation Act ought to receive such a construction as the language in its plain meaning imports  Great hardship may occasionally be caused by statutes of limitation in cases of poverty, distress and ignorance of rights, yet the statutory rules must be enforced according to their ordinary meaning in these and in other like cases. pages 74-75 25. Shri Deshmukhs other argument that since no period of limitation has been provided in section 37 of the Arbitration Act, as a result of which the neat division contained in the Limitation Act of different matters contained in suits, appeals and applications will somehow have to be destroyed, the word appeals has to be read into applications so that Article 137 of the Limitation Act could apply, is also rejected. 26. Even in the rare situation in which an appeal under section 37 of the Arbitration Act would be of a specified value less than three lakh rupees, resulting in Article 116 or 117 of the Limitation Act applying, the main object of the Arbitration Act requiring speedy resolution of disputes would be the most important principle to be applied when applications under section 5 of the Limitation Act are filed to condone delay beyond 90 days andor 30 days depending upon whether Article 116a or 116b or 117 applies. As a matter of fact, given the timelines contained in sections 8, 92, 114, 1113, 132-5, 29A, 29B, 333-5 and 343 of the Arbitration Act, and the observations made in some of this Courts judgments, the object of speedy resolution of disputes would govern appeals covered by Articles 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act. 27. This Court in Union of India v. Popular Construction Co., 2001 8 SCC 470, put it thus 14. Here the history and scheme of the 1996 Act support the conclusion that the time-limit prescribed under Section 34 to challenge an award is absolute and unextendible by court under Section 5 of the Limitation Act. The Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 1995 which preceded the 1996 Act stated as one of its main objectives the need to minimise the supervisory role of courts in the arbitral process  Para 4v of the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 . This objective has found expression in Section 5 of the Act which prescribes the extent of judicial intervention in no uncertain terms 5. Extent of judicial intervention. Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by this Part, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this Part. 15. The Part referred to in Section 5 is Part I of the 1996 Act which deals with domestic arbitrations. Section 34 is contained in Part I and is therefore subject to the sweep of the prohibition contained in Section 5 of the 1996 Act. 28. Likewise, in State of Goa v. Western Builders, 2006 6 SCC 239, this Court, while stating that the provisions of section 14 of the Limitation Act would apply to applications filed under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, held 25.  It is true that the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 intended to expedite commercial issues expeditiously. It is also clear in the Statement of Objects and Reasons that in order to recognise economic reforms the settlement of both domestic and international commercial disputes should be disposed of quickly so that the countrys economic progress be expedited 29. The judgment in Kandla Export Corpn supra also observed 27. The matter can be looked at from a slightly different angle. Given the objects of both the statutes, it is clear that arbitration itself is meant to be a speedy resolution of disputes between parties. Equally, enforcement of foreign awards should take place as soon as possible if India is to remain as an equal partner, commercially speaking, in the international community. In point of fact, the raison dêtre for the enactment of the Commercial Courts Act is that commercial disputes involving high amounts of money should be speedily decided. Given the objects of both the enactments, if we were to provide an additional appeal, when Section 50 does away with an appeal so as to speedily enforce foreign awards, we would be turning the Arbitration Act and the Commercial Courts Act on their heads. Admittedly, if the amount contained in a foreign award to be enforced in India were less than Rs 1 crore, and a Single Judge of a High Court were to enforce such award, no appeal would lie, in keeping with the object of speedy enforcement of foreign awards. However, if, in the same fact circumstance, a foreign award were to be for Rs 1 crore or more, if the appellants are correct, enforcement of such award would be further delayed by providing an appeal under Section 131 of the Commercial Courts Act. Any such interpretation would lead to absurdity, and would be directly contrary to the object sought to be achieved by the Commercial Courts Act viz. speedy resolution of disputes of a commercial nature involving a sum of Rs 1 crore and over. For this reason also, we feel that Section 131 of the Commercial Courts Act must be construed in accordance with the object sought to be achieved by the Act. Any construction of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, which would lead to further delay, instead of an expeditious enforcement of a foreign award must, therefore, be eschewed. Even on applying the doctrine of harmonious construction of both statutes, it is clear that they are best harmonised by giving effect to the special statute i.e. the Arbitration Act, vis-à-vis the more general statute, namely, the Commercial Courts Act, being left to operate in spheres other than arbitration. 30. A recent judgment of this Court in ICOMM Tele Ltd. v. Punjab State Water Supply and Sewerage Board, 2019 4 SCC 401, states 25. Several judgments of this Court have also reiterated that the primary object of arbitration is to reach a final disposal of disputes in a speedy, effective, inexpensive and expeditious manner. Thus, in Centrotrade Minerals  Metal Inc. v. Hindustan Copper Ltd. Centrotrade Minerals  Metal Inc. v. Hindustan Copper Ltd., 2017 2 SCC 228  2017 1 SCC Civ 593 , this Court held SCC p. 250, para 39 39. In Union of India v. U.P. State Bridge Corpn. Ltd. Union of India v. U.P. State Bridge Corpn. Ltd., 2015 2 SCC 52  2015 1 SCC Civ 732 this Court accepted the view  Indu Malhotra, O.P. Malhotra on the Law and Practice of Arbitration and Conciliation 3rd Edn., Thomson Reuters, 2014. that the AC Act has four foundational pillars and then observed in para 16 of the Report that SCC p. 64 16. First and paramount principle of the first pillar is fair, speedy and inexpensive trial by an Arbitral Tribunal. Unnecessary delay or expense would frustrate the very purpose of arbitration. 31. Thus, from the scheme of the Arbitration Act as well as the aforesaid judgments, condonation of delay under section 5 of the Limitation Act has to be seen in the context of the object of speedy resolution of disputes. 32. The bulk of appeals, however, to the appellate court under section 37 of the Arbitration Act, are governed by section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. Sub-section 1A of section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act provides the forum for appeals as well as the limitation period to be followed, section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act being a special law as compared with the Limitation Act which is a general law, which follows from a reading of section 292 of the Limitation Act. Section 131A of the Commercial Courts Act lays down a period of limitation of 60 days uniformly for all appeals that are preferred under section 37 of the Arbitration Act. 1 33. The vexed question which faces us is whether, first and foremost, the application of section 5 of the Limitation Act is excluded by the scheme of the Commercial Courts Act, as has been argued by Dr. George. The first important thing to note is that section 131A of the Commercial Courts Act does not contain any provision akin to section 343 of the Arbitration Act. Section 131A of the Commercial Courts Act only provides for a limitation period of 60 days from the date of the judgment or order appealed against, without further going into whether delay beyond this period can or cannot be condoned. 34. It may also be pointed out that though the object of expeditious disposal of appeals is laid down in section 14 of the Commercial Courts Act, the language of section 14 makes it clear that the period of six months spoken of is directory and not mandatory. By way of contrast, section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act read with the Schedule thereof and the amendment made to Order VIII Rule 1 of the 1 As held in BGS SGS SOMA JV v. NHPC, 2020 4 SCC 234, whereas section 37 of the Arbitration Act provides the substantive right to appeal, section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act provides the forum and procedure governing the appeal see paragraph 13. CPC, would make it clear that the defendant in a suit is given 30 days to file a written statement, which period cannot be extended beyond 120 days from the date of service of the summons and on expiry of the said period, the defendant forfeits the right to file the written statement and the court cannot allow the written statement to be taken on record. This provision was enacted as a result of the judgment of this Court in Salem Advocate Bar Assn. II v. Union of India, 2005 6 SCC 344. 35. In a recent judgment of this Court namely, SCG Contracts India P Ltd. v. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure P Ltd., 2019 12 SCC 210, a Division Bench of this Court referred to the aforesaid amendment and its hard and fast nature as follows 8. The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 came into force on 23-10-2015 bringing in their wake certain amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure. In Order 5 Rule 1, sub-rule 1, for the second proviso, the following proviso was substituted Provided further that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred and twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. Equally, in Order 8 Rule 1, a new proviso was substituted as follows Provided that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred and twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred and twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. This was re-emphasised by re-inserting yet another proviso in Order 8 Rule 10 CPC, which reads as under 10. Procedure when party fails to present written statement called for by court.Where any party from whom a written statement is required under Rule 1 or Rule 9 fails to present the same within the time permitted or fixed by the court, as the case may be, the court shall pronounce judgment against him, or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit and on the pronouncement of such judgment a decree shall be drawn up Provided further that no court shall make an order to extend the time provided under Rule 1 of this Order for filing of the written statement. A perusal of these provisions would show that ordinarily a written statement is to be filed within a period of 30 days. However, grace period of a further 90 days is granted which the Court may employ for reasons to be recorded in writing and payment of such costs as it deems fit to allow such written statement to come on record. What is of great importance is the fact that beyond 120 days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record. This is further buttressed by the proviso in Order 8 Rule 10 also adding that the court has no further power to extend the time beyond this period of 120 days. 9. In Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti State of Bihar v. Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti, 2018 9 SCC 472  2018 4 SCC Civ 387 , a question was raised as to whether Section 345 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, inserted by Amending Act 3 of 2016 is mandatory or directory. In para 11 of the said judgment, this Court referred to Kailash v. Nanhku Kailash v. Nanhku, 2005 4 SCC 480 , referring to the text of Order 8 Rule 1 as it stood pre the amendment made by the Commercial Courts Act. It also referred in para 12 to Salem Advocate Bar Assn. 2 v. Union of India Salem Advocate Bar Assn. 2 v. Union of India, 2005 6 SCC 344 , which, like the Kailash Kailash v. Nanhku, 2005 4 SCC 480 judgment, held that the mere expression shall in Order 8 Rule 1 would not make the provision mandatory. This Court then went on to discuss in para 17 of State v. N.S. Gnaneswaran State v. N.S. Gnaneswaran, 2013 3 SCC 594  2013 3 SCC Cri 235  2013 1 SCC LS 688 , in which Section 1542 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was held to be directory inasmuch as no consequence was provided if the section was breached. In para 22 by way of contrast to Section 34, Section 29-A of the Arbitration Act was set out. This Court then noted in para 23 as under Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti case State of Bihar v. Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti, 2018 9 SCC 472  2018 4 SCC Civ 387 , SCC p. 489 23. It will be seen from this provision that, unlike Sections 345 and 6, if an award is made beyond the stipulated or extended period contained in the section, the consequence of the mandate of the arbitrator being terminated is expressly provided. This provision is in stark contrast to Sections 345 and 6 where, as has been stated hereinabove, if the period for deciding the application under Section 34 has elapsed, no consequence is provided. This is one more indicator that the same Amendment Act, when it provided time periods in different situations, did so intending different consequences. 10. Several High Court judgments on the amended Order 8 Rule 1 have now held that given the consequence of non- filing of written statement, the amended provisions of the CPC will have to be held to be mandatory. See Oku Tech P Ltd. v. Sangeet Agarwal Oku Tech P Ltd. v. Sangeet Agarwal, 2016 SCC OnLine Del 6601 by a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court dated 11-8-2016 in CS OS No. 3390 of 2015 as followed by several other judgments including a judgment of the Delhi High Court in Maja Cosmetics v. Oasis Commercial P Ltd. Maja Cosmetics v. Oasis Commercial P Ltd., 2018 SCC OnLine Del 6698 11. We are of the view that the view taken by the Delhi High Court in these judgments is correct in view of the fact that the consequence of forfeiting a right to file the written statement non-extension of any further time and the fact that the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record all points to the fact that the earlier law on Order 8 Rule 1 on the filing of written statement under Order 8 Rule 1 has now been set at naught. 36. By way of contrast, there is no such provision contained in section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. The judgment in Hongo supra, strongly relied upon by Dr. George, is clearly distinguishable. In Hongo supra, section 35-H of the Central Excise Act provided for a period of 180 days for filing a reference application to the High Court. The scheme of the Central Excise Act was adverted to in paragraph 15 of the judgment, which reads as follows 15. We have already pointed out that in the case of appeal to the Commissioner, Section 35 provides 60 days time and in addition to the same, the Commissioner has power to condone the delay up to 30 days, if sufficient cause is shown. Likewise, Section 35-B provides 90 days time for filing appeal to the Appellate Tribunal and sub-section 5 therein enables the Appellate Tribunal to condone the delay irrespective of the number of days, if sufficient cause is shown. Likewise, Section 35-EE which provides 90 days time for filing revision by the Central Government and, proviso to the same enables the revisional authority to condone the delay for a further period of 90 days, if sufficient cause is shown, whereas in the case of appeal to the High Court under Section 35-G and reference to the High Court under Section 35-H of the Act, total period of 180 days has been provided for availing the remedy of appeal and the reference. However, there is no further clause empowering the High Court to condone the delay after the period of 180 days. 37. The Court then went on to observe 33. Even otherwise, for filing an appeal to the Commissioner, and to the Appellate Tribunal as well as revision to the Central Government, the legislature has provided 60 days and 90 days respectively, on the other hand, for filing an appeal and reference to the High Court larger period of 180 days has been provided with to enable the Commissioner and the other party to avail the same. We are of the view that the legislature provided sufficient time, namely, 180 days for filing reference to the High Court which is more than the period prescribed for an appeal and revision. 34. Though, an argument was raised based on Section 29 of the Limitation Act, even assuming that Section 292 would be attracted, what we have to determine is whether the provisions of this section are expressly excluded in the case of reference to the High Court. 35. It was contended before us that the words expressly excluded would mean that there must be an express reference made in the special or local law to the specific provisions of the Limitation Act of which the operation is to be excluded. In this regard, we have to see the scheme of the special law which here in this case is the Central Excise Act. The nature of the remedy provided therein is such that the legislature intended it to be a complete code by itself which alone should govern the several matters provided by it. If, on an examination of the relevant provisions, it is clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act are necessarily excluded, then the benefits conferred therein cannot be called in aid to supplement the provisions of the Act. In our considered view, that even in a case where the special law does not exclude the provisions of Sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act by an express reference, it would nonetheless be open to the court to examine whether and to what extent, the nature of those provisions or the nature of the subject-matter and scheme of the special law exclude their operation. In other words, the applicability of the provisions of the Limitation Act, therefore, is to be judged not from the terms of the Limitation Act but by the provisions of the Central Excise Act relating to filing of reference application to the High Court. 36. The scheme of the Central Excise Act, 1944 supports the conclusion that the time-limit prescribed under Section 35-H1 to make a reference to the High Court is absolute and unextendable by a court under Section 5 of the Limitation Act. It is well-settled law that it is the duty of the court to respect the legislative intent and by giving liberal interpretation, limitation cannot be extended by invoking the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act. 38. Unlike the scheme of the Central Excise Act relied upon in Hongo supra, there are no other provisions in the Commercial Courts Act which provide for a period of limitation coupled with a condonation of delay provision which is either open-ended or capped. Also, the period of 180 days provided was one indicia which led the Court to exclude the application of section 5 of the Limitation Act, as it was double and triple the period provided for appeals under the other provisions of the same Act. Section 131A of the Commercial Courts Act, by way of contrast, applies an intermediate period of 60 days for filing an appeal, that is, a period that is halfway between 30 days and 90 days provided by Articles 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act. 39. The other judgments relied upon by Dr. George are all distinguishable in that they are judgments which deal with provisions that provide for a period of limitation and a period of condonation of delay beyond which delay cannot be condoned, such as section 125 of the Electricity Act. See Suryachakra Power Corpn. Ltd. v. Electricity Deptt., 2016 16 SCC 152 at paragraph 10 ONGC v. Gujarat Energy Transmission Corpn. Ltd., 2017 5 SCC 42 at paragraphs 5-10. 40. Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act was also pressed into service stating that the non-obstante clause contained in the Commercial Courts Act would override other Acts, including the Limitation Act, as a result of which, the applicability of section 5 thereof would be excluded. This argument has been addressed in the context of the IBC in B.K. Educational Services P Ltd. v. Parag Gupta  Associates, 2019 11 SCC 633, as follows 41. Shri Dholakia argued that the Code being complete in itself, an intruder such as the Limitation Act must be shut out also by application of Section 238 of the Code which provides that, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force, the provisions of the Code would override such laws. In fact, Section 606 of the Code specifically states as follows 60. Adjudicating authority for corporate persons.1-5    6 Notwithstanding anything contained in the Limitation Act, 1963 36 of 1963 or in any other law for the time being in force, in computing the period of limitation specified for any suit or application by or against a corporate debtor for which an order of moratorium has been made under this Part, the period during which such moratorium is in place shall be excluded. This provision would have been wholly unnecessary if the Limitation Act was otherwise excluded either by reason of the Code being complete in itself or by virtue of Section 238 of the Code. Both, Section 433 of the Companies Act as well as Section 238-A of the Code, apply the provisions of the Limitation Act as far as may be. Obviously, therefore, where periods of limitation have been laid down in the Code, these periods will apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Limitation Act. From this, it does not follow that the baby must be thrown out with the bathwater. This argument, therefore, must also be rejected. 41. For all these reasons we reject the argument made by Shri George that the application of section 5 of the Limitation Act is excluded given the scheme of Commercial Courts Act. 42. The next important argument that needs to be addressed is as to whether the hard and fast rule applied by this Court in N.V. International supra is correct in law. Firstly, as has correctly been argued by Shri Shroti, N.V. International supra does not notice the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act at all and can be said to be per incuriam on this count. Secondly, it is also correct to note that the period of 90 days plus 30 days and not thereafter mentioned in section 343 of the Arbitration Act cannot now apply, the limitation period for filing of appeals under the Commercial Courts Act being 60 days and not 90 days. Thirdly, the argument that absent a provision curtailing the condonation of delay beyond the period provided in section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act would also make it clear that any such bodily lifting of the last part of section 343 into section 37 of the Arbitration Act would also be unwarranted. We cannot accept Shri Navares argument that this is a mere casus omissus which can be filled in by the Court. 43. The difference between interpretation and legislation is sometimes a fine one, as it has repeatedly been held that judges do not merely interpret the law but also create law. In Eera v. State NCT of Delhi, 2017 15 SCC 133, this Court was faced with the interpretation of section 21d of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. This provision reads as follows 21d child means any person below the age of eighteen years 44. The argument made before the Court was that the age of 18 years did not only refer to physical age, but could also refer to the mental age of the child as defined. This Court was therefore faced with the difficulty between interpreting the law as it stands, and legislating. The concurring judgment of Nariman, J. put it thus 103. Having read the erudite judgment of my learned Brother, and agreeing fully with him on the conclusion reached, given the importance of the Montesquiean separation of powers doctrine where the judiciary should not transgress from the field of judicial law-making into the field of legislative law-making, I have felt it necessary to add a few words of my own. 104. Mr Sanjay R. Hegde, the learned Amicus Curiae, has argued before us that the interpretation of Section 21d of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 cannot include mental age as such an interpretation would be beyond the Lakshman Rekha  that is, it is no part of this Courts function to add to or amend the law as it stands. This Courts function is limited to interpreting the law as it stands, and this being the case, he has exhorted us not to go against the plain literal meaning of the statute. 105. Since Mr Hegdes argument raises the constitutional spectre of separation of powers, let it first be admitted that under our constitutional scheme, Judges only declare the law it is for the legislatures to make the law. This much at least is clear on a conjoint reading of Articles 141 and 245 of the Constitution of India, which are set out hereinbelow 141. Law declared by Supreme Court to be binding on all courts.The law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of India.  245. Extent of laws made by Parliament and by the legislatures of States.1 Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, Parliament may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India, and the legislature of a State may make laws for the whole or any part of the State. 2 No law made by Parliament shall be deemed to be invalid on the ground that it would have extra-territorial operation. emphasis supplied 106. That the legislature cannot declare law is embedded in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence. Bills of attainder, which used to be passed by Parliament in England, have never been passed from the 18th century onwards. A legislative judgment is anathema. As early as 1789, the US Constitution expressly outlawed bills of attainder vide Article I Section 93. This being the case with the legislature, the counter-argument is that the Judiciary equally cannot make but can only declare law. While declaring the law, can Judges make law as well?... 45. The concurring judgment went on to state 127. It is thus clear on a reading of English, US, Australian and our own Supreme Court judgments that the Lakshman Rekha has in fact been extended to move away from the strictly literal rule of interpretation back to the rule of the old English case of Heydon Heydon case, 1584 3 Co Rep 7a  76 ER 637 , where the Court must have recourse to the purpose, object, text and context of a particular provision before arriving at a judicial result. In fact, the wheel has turned full circle. It started out by the rule as stated in 1584 in Heydon case Heydon case, 1584 3 Co Rep 7a  76 ER 637 , which was then waylaid by the literal interpretation rule laid down by the Privy Council and the House of Lords in the mid-1800s, and has come back to restate the rule somewhat in terms of what was most felicitously put over 400 years ago in Heydon case Heydon case, 1584 3 Co Rep 7a  76 ER 637 . 139. A reading of the Act as a whole in the light of the Statement of Objects and Reasons thus makes it clear that the intention of the legislator was to focus on children, as commonly understood i.e. persons who are physically under the age of 18 years. The golden rule in determining whether the judiciary has crossed the Lakshman Rekha in the guise of interpreting a statute is really whether a Judge has only ironed out the creases that he found in a statute in the light of its object, or whether he has altered the material of which the Act is woven. In short, the difference is the well-known philosophical difference between is and ought. Does the Judge put himself in the place of the legislator and ask himself whether the legislator intended a certain result, or does he state that this must have been the intent of the legislator and infuse what he thinks should have been done had he been the legislator. If the latter, it is clear that the Judge then would add something more than what there is in the statute by way of a supposed intention of the legislator and would go beyond creative interpretation of legislation to legislating itself. It is at this point that the Judge crosses the Lakshman Rekha and becomes a legislator, stating what the law ought to be instead of what the law is. 46. Ultimately, the judgment concluded 146. A reading of the Objects and Reasons of the aforesaid Act together with the provisions contained therein would show that whatever is the physical age of the person affected, such person would be a person with disability who would be governed by the provisions of the said Act. Conspicuous by its absence is the reference to any age when it comes to protecting persons with disabilities under the said Act. 147. Thus, it is clear that viewed with the lens of the legislator, we would be doing violence both to the intent and the language of Parliament if we were to read the word mental into Section 21d of the 2012 Act. Given the fact that it is a beneficialpenal legislation, we as Judges can extend it only as far as Parliament intended and no further. I am in agreement, therefore, with the judgment of my learned Brother, including the directions given by him. 47. Given the lakshman rekha laid down in this judgment, it is a little difficult to appreciate how a cap can be judicially engrafted onto a statutory provision which then bars condonation of delay by even one day beyond the cap so engrafted. 48. Shri George, however, relied upon the judgments of this Court in Chandi Prasad v. Jagdish Prasad, 2004 8 SCC 724 at paragraph 22 and D. Purushotama Reddy v. K. Sateesh, 2008 8 SCC 505 at paragraph 11, to support the reasoning contained in Varindera Constructions supra and N.V. International supra. He relied strongly upon paragraph 11 of the judgment in D. Purushotama Reddy v. K. Sateesh, 2008 8 SCC 505, which reads as follows 11. We have noticed hereinbefore that whereas the judgment of conviction and sentence was passed on 15- 12-2005, the suit was decreed by the civil court on 23-1- 2006. Deposit of a sum of Rs 2,00,000 by the appellants in favour of the respondent herein, was directed by the criminal court. Such an order should have been taken into consideration by the trial court. An appeal from a decree, furthermore, is a continuation of suit. The limitation of power on a civil court should also be borne in mind by the appellate court. Was any duty cast upon the civil court to consider the amount of compensation deposited in terms of Section 357 of the Code is the question. 49. From this paragraph, what was sought to be argued was that the limitation of power on a civil court at the initial stage can be read as a limitation onto the appellate court, as was done in the aforesaid judgments. We are afraid that we are unable to agree. This sentence was in the context of a decree passed in a civil suit for a sum of rupees 3.09 lakh with interest, without taking into consideration the fact that an amount of rupees 2.10 lakh had already been deposited by the appellant in criminal proceedings. The Court relied upon section 3575 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to hold that the court shall take into account any sum paid or recovered as compensation at the time of awarding compensation in any subsequent civil suit relating to the same matter. The court would obviously include an appellate court as well. It was only in this context that the aforesaid observation of limitation of power on a civil court being borne in mind by the appellate court, was made. 50. Shri Georges reliance upon the judgment of this Court in P. Radha Bai v. P. Ashok Kumar, 2019 13 SCC 445 at paragraphs 36.2-36.3 on the doctrine of unbreakability when applied to section 343 of the Arbitration Act, also does not carry the matter much further, as the question is whether this doctrine can be bodily lifted and engrafted onto an appeal provision that has no cut-off point beyond which delay cannot be condoned. For all these reasons, given the illuminating arguments made in these appeals, we are of the view that N.V. International supra has been wrongly decided and is therefore overruled. 51. However, the matter does not end here. The question still arises as to the application of section 5 of the Limitation Act to appeals which are governed by a uniform 60-day period of limitation. At one extreme, we have the judgment in N.V. International supra which does not allow condonation of delay beyond 30 days, and at the other extreme, we have an open-ended provision in which any amount of delay can be condoned, provided sufficient cause is shown. It is between these two extremes that we have to steer a middle course. 52. One judicial tool with which to steer this course is contained in the latin maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat. This maxim was fleshed out in CIT v. Hindustan Bulk Carriers, 2003 3 SCC 57 as follows2 14. A construction which reduces the statute to a futility has to be avoided. A statute or any enacting provision therein must be so construed as to make it effective and operative on the principle expressed in the maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat i.e. a liberal construction should be put upon written instruments, so as to uphold them, if possible, and carry into effect the intention of the parties. See Brooms Legal Maxims 10th Edn., p. 361, Craies on Statutes 7th Edn., p. 95 and Maxwell on Statutes 11th Edn., p. 221. 15. A statute is designed to be workable and the interpretation thereof by a court should be to secure that object unless crucial omission or clear direction makes that end unattainable. See Whitney v. IRC 1926 AC 37  10 Tax Cas 88  95 LJKB 165  134 LT 98 HL , AC at p. 52 referred to in CIT v. S. Teja Singh AIR 1959 SC 352  1959 35 ITR 408 and Gursahai Saigal v. CIT AIR 1963 SC 1062  1963 48 ITR 1 . 16. The courts will have to reject that construction which will defeat the plain intention of the legislature even though there may be some inexactitude in the language used. See Salmon v. Duncombe 1886 11 AC 627  55 LJPC 69  55 LT 446 PC AC at p. 634, Curtis v. Stovin 1889 22 QBD 513  58 LJQB 174  60 LT 772 CA referred to in S. Teja Singh case AIR 1959 SC 352  1959 35 ITR 408. 2 Followed in the separate opinion delivered by Pasayat, J. in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India, 2008 6 SCC 1 see paragraphs 333-334. 17. If the choice is between two interpretations, the narrower of which would fail to achieve the manifest purpose of the legislation, we should avoid a construction which would reduce the legislation to futility, and should rather accept the bolder construction, based on the view that Parliament would legislate only for the purpose of bringing about an effective result. See Nokes v. Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries 1940 3 All ER 549  1940 AC 1014  109 LJKB 865  163 LT 343 HL referred to in Pye v. Minister for Lands for NSW 1954 3 All ER 514  1954 1 WLR 1410 PC . The principles indicated in the said cases were reiterated by this Court in Mohan Kumar Singhania v. Union of India 1992 Supp 1 SCC 594  1992 SCC LS 455  1992 19 ATC 881  AIR 1992 SC 1 . 18. The statute must be read as a whole and one provision of the Act should be construed with reference to other provisions in the same Act so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole statute. 19. The court must ascertain the intention of the legislature by directing its attention not merely to the clauses to be construed but to the entire statute it must compare the clause with other parts of the law and the setting in which the clause to be interpreted occurs. See R.S. Raghunath v. State of Karnataka 1992 1 SCC 335  1992 SCC LS 286  1992 19 ATC 507  AIR 1992 SC 81 . Such a construction has the merit of avoiding any inconsistency or repugnancy either within a section or between two different sections or provisions of the same statute. It is the duty of the court to avoid a head-on clash between two sections of the same Act. See Sultana Begum v. Prem Chand Jain 1997 1 SCC 373  AIR 1997 SC 1006 . 20. Whenever it is possible to do so, it must be done to construe the provisions which appear to conflict so that they harmonise. It should not be lightly assumed that Parliament had given with one hand what it took away with the other. 21. The provisions of one section of the statute cannot be used to defeat those of another unless it is impossible to effect reconciliation between them. Thus a construction that reduces one of the provisions to a useless lumber or dead letter is not a harmonised construction. To harmonise is not to destroy. 53. Reading the Arbitration Act and the Commercial Courts Act as a whole, it is clear that when section 37 of the Arbitration Act is read with either Article 116 or 117 of the Limitation Act or section 131A of the Commercial Courts Act, the object and context provided by the aforesaid statutes, read as a whole, is the speedy disposal of appeals filed under section 37 of the Arbitration Act. To read section 5 of the Limitation Act consistently with the aforesaid object, it is necessary to discover as to what the expression sufficient cause means in the context of condoning delay in filing appeals under section 37 of the Arbitration Act. 54. The expression sufficient cause contained in section 5 of the Limitation Act is elastic enough to yield different results depending upon the object and context of a statute. Thus, in Ajmer Kaur v. State of Punjab, 2004 7 SCC 381, this Court, in the context of section 115 of the Punjab Land Reforms Act, 1972, held as follows 10. Permitting an application under Section 115 to be moved at any time would have disastrous consequences. The State Government in which the land vests on being declared as surplus, will not be able to utilise the same. The State Government cannot be made to wait indefinitely before putting the land to use. Where the land is utilised by the State Government, a consequence of the order passed subsequently could be of divesting it of the land. Taking the facts of the present case by way of an illustration, it would mean that the land which stood mutated in the State Government in 1982 and which was allotted by the State Government to third parties in 1983, would as a result of reopening the settled position, lead to third parties being asked to restore back the land to the State Government and the State Government in turn would have to be divested of the land. The land will in turn be restored to the landowner. This will be the result of the land being declared by the Collector as not surplus with the landowner. The effect of permitting such a situation will be that the land will remain in a situation of flux. There will be no finality. The very purpose of the legislation will be defeated. The allottee will not be able to utilise the land for fear of being divested in the event of deaths and births in the family of the landowners. Deaths and births are events which are bound to occur. Therefore, it is reasonable to read a time-limit in sub-section 5 of Section 11. The concept of reasonable time in the given facts would be most appropriate. An application must be moved within a reasonable time. The facts of the present case demonstrate that redetermination under sub-section 5 of Section 11 almost 5 years after the death of Kartar Kaur and more than 6 years after the order of the Collector declaring the land as surplus had become final, has resulted in grave injustice besides defeating the object of the legislation which was envisaged as a socially beneficial piece of legislation. Thus we hold that the application for redetermination filed by Daya Singh under sub-section 5 of Section 11 of the Act on 21-6-1985 was liable to be dismissed on the ground of inordinate delay and the Collector was wrong in reopening the issue declaring the land as not surplus in the hands of Daya Singh and Kartar Kaur. 11. The above reasoning is in consonance with the provision in sub-section 7 of Section 11 of the Act. Sub- section 7 uses the words where succession has opened after the surplus area or any part thereof has been determined by the Collector . The words determined by the Collector would mean that the order of the Collector has attained finality. The provisions regarding appeals, etc. contained in Sections 80-82 of the Punjab Tenancy Act, 1887, as made applicable to proceedings under the Punjab Land Reforms Act, 1972, show that the maximum period of limitation in case of appeal or review is ninety days. The appeal against the final order of the Collector dated 30-9- 1976 whereby 3.12 hectares of land had been declared as surplus was dismissed on 27-3-1979. The order was allowed to become final as it was not challenged any further. Thus the determination by the Collector became final on 27-3-1979. The same could not be reopened after a lapse of more than 6 years by order dated 23-7-1985. The subsequent proceedings before the Revenue Authorities did not lie. The order dated 23-7-1985 is non est. All the subsequent proceedings therefore fall through. The issue could not have been reopened. emphasis supplied 55. Nearer home, in Brahampal v. National Insurance Company, 2020 SCC OnLine SC 1053, this Court specifically referred to the difference between a delay in filing commercial claims under the Arbitration Act or the Commercial Courts Act and claims under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, as follows 16. This Court has firstly held that purpose of conferment of such power must be examined for the determination of the scope of such discretion conferred upon the court. refer to Bhaiya Punjalal Bhagwandin v. Dave Bhagwatprasad Prabhuprasad, AIR 1963 SC 120 Shri Prakash Chand Agarwal v. Hindustan Steel Ltd., 1970 2 SCC 806. Our analysis of the purpose of the Act suggests that such discretionary power is conferred upon the Courts, to enforce the rights of the victims and their dependents. The legislature intended that Courts must have such power so as to ensure that substantive justice is not trumped by technicalities. emphasis supplied 22. Therefore, the aforesaid provision being a beneficial legislation, must be given liberal interpretation to serve its object. Keeping in view the substantive rights of the parties, undue emphasis should not be given to technicalities. In such cases delay in filing and refiling cannot be viewed strictly, as compared to commercial claims under the Arbitration and Concilliation Act, 1996 or the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. In P. Radha Bai v. P. Ashok Kumar, 2019 13 SCC 445, wherein this Court while interpreting Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, held that the right to object to an award itself is substantively bound with the limitation period prescribed therein and the same cannot merely a procedural prescription. In effect the Court held that a complete petition, has to be filed within the time prescribed under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act and not thereafter. The Court while coming to the aforesaid conclusion, reasoned as under 36.1 First, the purpose of the Arbitration Act was to provide for a speedy dispute resolution process. The Statement of Objects and Reasons reveal that the legislative intent of enacting the Arbitration Act was to provide parties with an efficient alternative dispute resolution system which gives litigants an expedited resolution of disputes while reducing the burden on the courts. Article 343 reflects this intent when it defines the commencement and concluding period for challenging an award. This Court in Popular Construction case Union of India v. Popular Construction Co., 2001 8 SCC 470 highlighted the importance of the fixed periods under the Arbitration Act. We may also add that the finality is a fundamental principle enshrined under the Arbitration Act and a definitive time- limit for challenging an award is necessary for ensuring finality. If Section 17 were to be applied, an award can be challenged even after 120 days. This would defeat the Arbitration Acts objective of speedy resolution of disputes. The finality of award would also be in a limbo as a party can challenge an award even after the 120 day period. emphasis in original 23. Coming back to the Motor Vehicles Act, the legislative intent is to provide appropriate compensation for the victims and to protect their substantive rights, in pursuit of the same, the interpretation should not be as strict as commercial claims as elucidated above. 24. Undoubtedly, the statute has granted the Courts with discretionary powers to condone the delay, however at the same time it also places an obligation upon the party to justify that he was prevented from abiding by the same due to the existence of sufficient cause. Although there exists no strait jacket formula for the Courts to condone delay, but the Courts must not only take into consideration the entire facts and circumstances of case but also the conduct of the parties. The concept of reasonableness dictates that, the Courts even while taking a liberal approach must weigh in the rights and obligations of both the parties. When a right has accrued in favour of one party due to gross negligence and lackadaisical attitude of the other, this Court shall refrain from exercising the aforesaid discretionary relief. 25. Taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the present case, we are of the opinion that the delay of 45 days has been properly explained by the appellants, which was on account of illness of the wife of Appellant No. 1. It was not appropriate on the part of the High Court to dismiss the appeal merely on the ground of delay of short duration, particularly in matters involving death in motor accident claims. Moreover, in the present case no mala fide can be imputable against the appellants for filing the appeal after the expiry of ninety days. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the strict approach taken in the impugned order is hyper-technical and cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. emphasis supplied 56. Given the object sought to be achieved under both the Arbitration Act and the Commercial Courts Act, that is, the speedy resolution of disputes, the expression sufficient cause is not elastic enough to cover long delays beyond the period provided by the appeal provision itself. Besides, the expression sufficient cause is not itself a loose panacea for the ill of pressing negligent and stale claims. This Court, in Basawaraj v. Land Acquisition Officer, 2013 14 SCC 81, has held 9. Sufficient cause is the cause for which the defendant could not be blamed for his absence. The meaning of the word sufficient is adequate or enough, inasmuch as may be necessary to answer the purpose intended. Therefore, the word sufficient embraces no more than that which provides a platitude, which when the act done suffices to accomplish the purpose intended in the facts and circumstances existing in a case, duly examined from the viewpoint of a reasonable standard of a cautious man. In this context, sufficient cause means that the party should not have acted in a negligent manner or there was a want of bona fide on its part in view of the facts and circumstances of a case or it cannot be alleged that the party has not acted diligently or remained inactive. However, the facts and circumstances of each case must afford sufficient ground to enable the court concerned to exercise discretion for the reason that whenever the court exercises discretion, it has to be exercised judiciously. The applicant must satisfy the court that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from prosecuting his case, and unless a satisfactory explanation is furnished, the court should not allow the application for condonation of delay. The court has to examine whether the mistake is bona fide or was merely a device to cover an ulterior purpose. See Manindra Land and Building Corpn. Ltd. v. Bhutnath Banerjee AIR 1964 SC 1336 , Mata Din v. A. Narayanan 1969 2 SCC 770  AIR 1970 SC 1953 , Parimal v. Veena 2011 3 SCC 545  2011 2 SCC Civ 1  AIR 2011 SC 1150 and Maniben Devraj Shah v. Municipal Corpn. of Brihan Mumbai 2012 5 SCC 157  2012 3 SCC Civ 24  AIR 2012 SC 1629 . 10. In Arjun Singh v. Mohindra Kumar AIR 1964 SC 993 this Court explained the difference between a good cause and a sufficient cause and observed that every sufficient cause is a good cause and vice versa. However, if any difference exists it can only be that the requirement of good cause is complied with on a lesser degree of proof than that of sufficient cause. 11. The expression sufficient cause should be given a liberal interpretation to ensure that substantial justice is done, but only so long as negligence, inaction or lack of bona fides cannot be imputed to the party concerned, whether or not sufficient cause has been furnished, can be decided on the facts of a particular case and no straitjacket formula is possible. Vide Madanlal v. Shyamlal 2002 1 SCC 535  AIR 2002 SC 100 and Ram Nath Sao v. Gobardhan Sao 2002 3 SCC 195  AIR 2002 SC 1201 . 12. It is a settled legal proposition that law of limitation may harshly affect a particular party but it has to be applied with all its rigour when the statute so prescribes. The court has no power to extend the period of limitation on equitable grounds. A result flowing from a statutory provision is never an evil. A court has no power to ignore that provision to relieve what it considers a distress resulting from its operation. The statutory provision may cause hardship or inconvenience to a particular party but the court has no choice but to enforce it giving full effect to the same. The legal maxim dura lex sed lex which means the law is hard but it is the law, stands attracted in such a situation. It has consistently been held that, inconvenience is not a decisive factor to be considered while interpreting a statute. 13. The statute of limitation is founded on public policy, its aim being to secure peace in the community, to suppress fraud and perjury, to quicken diligence and to prevent oppression. It seeks to bury all acts of the past which have not been agitated unexplainably and have from lapse of time become stale. According to Halsburys Laws of England, Vol. 28, p. 266 605. Policy of the Limitation Acts.The courts have expressed at least three differing reasons supporting the existence of statutes of limitations namely, 1 that long dormant claims have more of cruelty than justice in them, 2 that a defendant might have lost the evidence to disprove a stale claim, and 3 that persons with good causes of actions should pursue them with reasonable diligence. An unlimited limitation would lead to a sense of insecurity and uncertainty, and therefore, limitation prevents disturbance or deprivation of what may have been acquired in equity and justice by long enjoyment or what may have been lost by a partys own inaction, negligence or laches. See Popat and Kotecha Property v. SBI Staff Assn. 2005 7 SCC 510 , Rajender Singh v. Santa Singh 1973 2 SCC 705  AIR 1973 SC 2537 and Pundlik Jalam Patil v. Jalgaon Medium Project 2008 17 SCC 448  2009 5 SCC Civ 907 . 14. In P. Ramachandra Rao v. State of Karnataka 2002 4 SCC 578  2002 SCC Cri 830  AIR 2002 SC 1856 this Court held that judicially engrafting principles of limitation amounts to legislating and would fly in the face of law laid down by the Constitution Bench in Abdul Rehman Antulay v. R.S. Nayak 1992 1 SCC 225  1992 SCC Cri 93  AIR 1992 SC 1701 . 15. The law on the issue can be summarised to the effect that where a case has been presented in the court beyond limitation, the applicant has to explain the court as to what was the sufficient cause which means an adequate and enough reason which prevented him to approach the court within limitation. In case a party is found to be negligent, or for want of bona fide on his part in the facts and circumstances of the case, or found to have not acted diligently or remained inactive, there cannot be a justified ground to condone the delay. No court could be justified in condoning such an inordinate delay by imposing any condition whatsoever. The application is to be decided only within the parameters laid down by this Court in regard to the condonation of delay. In case there was no sufficient cause to prevent a litigant to approach the court on time condoning the delay without any justification, putting any condition whatsoever, amounts to passing an order in violation of the statutory provisions and it tantamounts to showing utter disregard to the legislature. emphasis supplied 57. Likewise, merely because the government is involved, a different yardstick for condonation of delay cannot be laid down. This was felicitously stated in Postmaster General v. Living Media India Ltd., 2012 3 SCC 563 Postmaster General, as follows 27. It is not in dispute that the persons concerned were well aware or conversant with the issues involved including the prescribed period of limitation for taking up the matter by way of filing a special leave petition in this Court. They cannot claim that they have a separate period of limitation when the Department was possessed with competent persons familiar with court proceedings. In the absence of plausible and acceptable explanation, we are posing a question why the delay is to be condoned mechanically merely because the Government or a wing of the Government is a party before us. 28. Though we are conscious of the fact that in a matter of condonation of delay when there was no gross negligence or deliberate inaction or lack of bona fides, a liberal concession has to be adopted to advance substantial justice, we are of the view that in the facts and circumstances, the Department cannot take advantage of various earlier decisions. The claim on account of impersonal machinery and inherited bureaucratic methodology of making several notes cannot be accepted in view of the modern technologies being used and available. The law of limitation undoubtedly binds everybody, including the Government. 29. In our view, it is the right time to inform all the government bodies, their agencies and instrumentalities that unless they have reasonable and acceptable explanation for the delay and there was bona fide effort, there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the file was kept pending for several monthsyears due to considerable degree of procedural red tape in the process. The government departments are under a special obligation to ensure that they perform their duties with diligence and commitment. Condonation of delay is an exception and should not be used as an anticipated benefit for the government departments. The law shelters everyone under the same light and should not be swirled for the benefit of a few. 58. The decision in Postmaster General supra has been followed in the following subsequent judgments of this Court i State of Rajasthan v. Bal Kishan Mathur, 2014 1 SCC 592 at paragraphs 8-8.2 ii State of U.P. v. Amar Nath Yadav, 2014 2 SCC 422 at paragraphs 2-3 iii State of T.N. v. N. Suresh Rajan, 2014 11 SCC 709 at paragraphs 11-13 and iv State of M.P. v. Bherulal, 2020 10 SCC 654 at paragraphs 3-4. 59. In a recent judgment, namely, State of M.P. v. Chaitram Maywade, 2020 10 SCC 667, this Court referred to Postmaster General supra, and held as follows 1. The State of Madhya Pradesh continues to do the same thing again and again and the conduct seems to be incorrigible. The special leave petition has been filed after a delay of 588 days. We had an occasion to deal with such inordinately delayed filing of the appeal by the State of Madhya Pradesh in State of M.P. v. Bherulal State of M.P. v. Bherulal, 2020 10 SCC 654 in terms of our order dated 15-10-2020. 2. We have penned down a detailed order in that case and we see no purpose in repeating the same reasoning again except to record what are stated to be the facts on which the delay is sought to be condoned. On 5-1-2019, it is stated that the Government Advocate was approached in respect of the judgment delivered on 13-11-2018 Chaitram Maywade v. State of M.P., 2018 SCC OnLine HP 1632 and the Law Department permitted filing of the SLP against the impugned order on 26-5-2020. Thus, the Law Department took almost about 17 months time to decide whether the SLP had to be filed or not. What greater certificate of incompetence would there be for the Legal Department! 3. We consider it appropriate to direct the Chief Secretary of the State of Madhya Pradesh to look into the aspect of revamping the Legal Department as it appears that the Department is unable to file appeals within any reasonable period of time much less within limitation. These kinds of excuses, as already recorded in the aforesaid order, are no more admissible in view of the judgment in Postmaster General v. Living Media India Ltd. Postmaster General v. Living Media India Ltd., 2012 3 SCC 563  2012 2 SCC Civ 327  2012 2 SCC Cri 580  2012 1 SCC LS 649 4. We have also expressed our concern that these kinds of the cases are only certificate cases to obtain a certificate of dismissal from the Supreme Court to put a quietus to the issue. The object is to save the skin of officers who may be in default. We have also recorded the irony of the situation where no action is taken against the officers who sit on these files and do nothing. 5. Looking to the period of delay and the casual manner in which the application has been worded, the wastage of judicial time involved, we impose costs on the petitioner State of Rs 35,000 to be deposited with the Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee. The amount be deposited within four weeks. The amount be recovered from the officers responsible for the delay in filing and sitting on the files and certificate of recovery of the said amount be also filed in this Court within the said period of time. We have put to Deputy Advocate General to caution that for any successive matters of this kind the costs will keep on going up. 60. Also, it must be remembered that merely because sufficient cause has been made out in the facts of a given case, there is no right in the appellant to have delay condoned. This was felicitously put in Ramlal v. Rewa Coalfields Ltd., 1962 2 SCR 762 as follows It is, however, necessary to emphasise that even after sufficient cause has been shown a party is not entitled to the condonation of delay in question as a matter of right. The proof of a sufficient cause is a condition precedent for the exercise of the discretionary jurisdiction vested in the court by s. 5. If sufficient cause is not proved nothing further has to be done the application for condoning delay has to be dismissed on that ground alone. If sufficient cause is shown then the Court has to enquire whether in its discretion it should condone the delay. This aspect of the matter naturally introduces the consideration of all relevant facts and it is at this stage that diligence of the party or its bona fides may fall for consideration but the scope of the enquiry while exercising the discretionary power after sufficient cause is shown would naturally be limited only to such facts as the Court may regard as relevant. It cannot justify an enquiry as to why the party was sitting idle during all the time available to it. In this connection we may point out that considerations of bona fides or due diligence are always material and relevant when the Court is dealing with applications made under s. 14 of the Limitation Act. In dealing with such applications the Court is called upon to consider the effect of the combined provisions of ss. 5 and 14. Therefore, in our opinion, considerations which have been expressly made material and relevant by the provisions of s. 14 cannot to the same extent and in the same manner be invoked in dealing with applications which fall to be decided only under s. 5 without reference to s. 14. page 771 61. Given the aforesaid and the object of speedy disposal sought to be achieved both under the Arbitration Act and the Commercial Courts Act, for appeals filed under section 37 of the Arbitration Act that are governed by Articles 116 and 117 of the Limitation Act or section 131A of the Commercial Courts Act, a delay beyond 90 days, 30 days or 60 days, respectively, is to be condoned by way of exception and not by way of rule. In a fit case in which a party has otherwise acted bona fide and not in a negligent manner, a short delay beyond such period can, in the discretion of the court, be condoned, always bearing in mind that the other side of the picture is that the opposite party may have acquired both in equity and justice, what may now be lost by the first partys inaction, negligence or laches. 62. Coming to the facts of the appeals before us, in the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP C No. 665 of 2021, the impugned judgment of the High Court of Bombay, dated 17.12.2020, has found that the Govt of Maharashtra had not approached the court bona fide, as follows 7. I have carefully gone through the papers. There can be no doubt in view of the documentary evidence in the form of copy of the application tendered by the Advocate representing the applicant for obtaining a certified copy Exhibit-R1 that in fact, after pronouncement of the judgment and order in the proceeding under Section 34 of the Act, the concerned Advocate had applied for certified copy on 14.05.2019. The endorsement further reads that it was to be handed over to Mr. A.D. Patil of the Irrigation Department, Dhule, who is a staff from the office of the applicant. The further endorsements also clearly show that the certified copy was ready and was to be delivered on 27.05.2019. In spite of such a stand and document, the applicant has not controverted this or has not come up with any other stand touching this aspect. It is therefore apparent that the applicant is not coming to the Court with clean hands even while seeking the discretionary relief of condonation of delay 63. Apart from this, there is a long delay of 131 days beyond the 60- day period provided for filing an appeal under section 131A of the Commercial Courts Act. There is no explanation worth the name contained in the condonation of delay application, beyond the usual file-pushing and administrative exigency. This appeal is therefore dismissed. 64. In the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP C No. 15278 of 2020, the impugned judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh dated 27.01.2020 relies upon Consolidated Engg. supra and thereby states that the judgment of this Court in N.V. International supra would not apply. The judgment of the High Court is wholly incorrect inasmuch as Consolidated Engg. supra was a judgment which applied the provisions of section 14 of the Limitation Act and had nothing to do with the application of section 5 of the Limitation Act. N.V. International supra was a direct judgment which applied the provisions of section 5 of the Limitation Act and then held that no condonation of delay could take place beyond 120 days. The High Court was bound to follow N.V. International supra, as on the date of the judgment of the High Court, N.V. International supra was a judgment of two learned judges of the Supreme Court binding upon the High Court by virtue of Article 141 of the Constitution. On this score, the impugned judgment of the High Court deserves to be set aside. 65. That apart, on the facts of this appeal, there is a long delay of 75 days beyond the period of 60 days provided by the Commercial Courts Act. Despite the fact that a certified copy of the District Courts judgment was obtained by the respondent on 27.04.2019, the appeal was filed only on 09.09.2019, the explanation for delay being 2. That, the certified copy of the order dated 01042013 was received by the appellant on 27042019. Thereafter the matter was placed before the CGM purchase MPPKVVCL for the compliance of the order. The same was then sent to the law officer, MPPKVVCL for opinion. 3. That after taking opinion for appeal, and approval of the concerned authorities, the officer-in-charge was appointed vide order dated 23072019. 4. That, thereafter due to bulky records of the case and for procurement of the necessary documents some delay has been caused however, the appeal has been prepared and filed to pursuant to the same and further delay. 5. That due to the aforesaid procedural approval and since the appellant is a public entity formed under the Energy department of the State Government, the delay caused in filing the appeal is bonafide and which deserves to be condoned. 66. This explanation falls woefully short of making out any sufficient cause. This appeal is therefore allowed and the condonation of delay is set aside on this score also. 67. In the Civil Appeal arising out of SLP C Diary No. 18079 of 2020, there is a huge delay of 227 days in filing the appeal, and a 200-day delay in refiling. The facts of this case also show that there was no sufficient cause whatsoever to condone such a long delay. The impugned judgment of the High Court of Delhi dated 15.10.2019 cannot be faulted on this score and this appeal is consequently dismissed. 68. Appeals disposed of accordingly. ..J. R. F.
